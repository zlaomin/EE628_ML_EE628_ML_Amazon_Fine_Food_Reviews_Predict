almond butter itself is simply not very good.  if, like me, you're used to almond butter from natural food stores, you're used to one ingredient -- almonds.  with barney butter, they load it up with extra oils and salt.  it tastes too sweet and too salty as a result.  this is like the mcdonald's of almond butter.  also, the separation problems cannot be easily overcome in a little packet like this.  with a jar, you just stir.  with a squeeze packet, you can try to keep kneading it and mixing it up before opening it, but the reality is, you're in for a huge blast of oil when you first open it, followed by a clay-like almond paste down below.<br /><br />second, the packaging is straight-up awful.  it's made of reinforced plastic, so you basically need talons to rip it open.  why they went with double-thick plastic for something you're supposed to tear is beyond me.  then, once it's open, the oil separation problems described above make it hard to get the almond butter to keep pushing up.  you have to keep tearing it again or cutting it as you inch your way down the tube.  and if you try to use your teeth to drag the almond butter up to the opening, you're in for some unpleasant cuts in the corners of your mouth due to the wide size of the packet.  it's just an all-around mess.<br /><br />i would never buy a jar of barney butter due to the unnecessary extra

only reason i follow this is to prevent any upset stomachs.  my cats would be happy to jump right in with new food.  i expected nothing different with the new $35 bag of wellness.  how wrong i was. for whatever reason, neither of my cats will touch this stuff. they ate around it when i had it mixed in with their other food. once i started filling their bowls exclusively with this wellness food, both of them stopped eating altogether. i carried the bowls to them, and both of them turned their faces away quickly and ran off.  i really don't understand what it is about this particular food that caused such a negative reaction.  the ingredient list appears fine, and i certainly paid a premium for this bag of food - which i will now have to throw out.  i thought about giving it to the local shelter, but if my former shelter cats hate it, then i don't want to pass it off on some other cats, especially if i happened to get a bad batch.  after another day of the cats refusing to eat, i headed out to 7-eleven late at night to buy a little box of whatever cat food they had on hand.  i brought home a small $2 box of friskies, and my cats ate it up immediately.  i don't plan to continue with friskies, but the fact that my cats went nuts for friskies (out of hunger, sure, but they had never eaten friskies in my home before), just confirmed my decision to throw out the wellness.  i cannot afford to ever buy this product again and i certainly cannot recommend it.", "the product contained many ant fragments, still identifiable with pieces such as thorax and legs, or head with

mail was delivered) ....the temp was almost 100 degrees.  i opened the box to find a huge mess!  the other brand oil was enclosed in a sealed plastic bag that was dry inside even though the oil itself was liquified....when i removed the lid, the seal on the top was completely intact.<br /><br />this product, however, was put in the box loose.  the plastic jar seal was unbroken but the lid turned easily so i could clearly see how the liquified oil had come out and gotten all over the interior of the box.....including the six cd\'s....with oil seeping up into their plastic coverings and onto the paper jackets.  when i broke the plastic "ring" that is supposed to seal the outside of the jar, i found that the seal on the top was not secured to the top but had come loose so the oil came out and under the loose top.....since it wasn\'t in a bag, it went everywhere in the box.  this was a packaging disaster all around!!!!<br /><br />i found this order didn\'t "qualify" for leaving feedback

fine but i certainly will never order again.<br /><br />update:  i was gratified to find that amazon reads these reviews and reacts to them....after posting this review, i received an email apologizing for my experience and advising that i would receive a replacement for the barlean\'s.  i did receive the barlean\'s which arrived with no problem; it was packed the same way but was sent two-day shipping so didn\'t sit in any heat for extended times....also, this jar didn\'t have the failed seal under the lid when i opened it.  i appreciate and was impressed by amazon\'s response but, to be honest, i have to wonder if when regularly shipped it still wouldn\'t be a problem since it\'s not enclosed in a plastic bag inside the box and if sent via usps in this heat is almost certainly

 it is extremely bitter and smells yucky.  no wonder he didn\'t eat!  also, it has lactose in it still so it did not help with his gas.  immediately when he started drinking, crazy gas!  this continued hours after he had finished eating and then time for another feeding.  we switched to baby\'s own organic lactose free and wow what a difference.  yes, it is a few dollars more but so worth it.  yes, he stil has a little gas but i would say it is normal baby gas and definetly not painful.  he eats 3-4oz a feeding and sleeps 2-3 hour stretches.  he is playful and happy.  much happier baby and much happier parents!

the noodles, no season packet or other add-ons.  seven ounces of dry product is more than enough to serve four as a side dish.<br /><br />i would have given the peacock brown rice vermicelli five stars, but i have a problem with the sideways packaging. the dry noodles, very fine, as expected, are packed sideways in the bag.  to cook the entire bag is easy--just dump it into the soaking

defend their position and indicate that they have no intention of changing back to the original formulation.  they have the effrontery to suggest that consumers who are complaining just didn\'t follow the directions correctly.  i made them a second time, before i threw out the rest of the box, just to make sure i had not made a mistake in following the directions.  nope.  they came out just as bad

both very nice teas and aren\'t noticeably different (unless you perhaps drink them side by side).  if you\'ve not had lapsang souchang before, the concept is a bit like earl grey, only instead of that sort of earthy oil flavor it\'s smokey.  not some sort of abstract smokiness like smoked salmon, but real "a forest is burning down somewhere nearby" smokey.  it is excellent with milk, and fine on its own.  i haven\'t had really expensive teas, so i don\'t know how this would compare to some of the "artisan" tea shops, but my guess is that if those are like great german beer, taylors or twinings are like a pretty decent english beer.<br /><br />lapsang souchang is also an excellent tea for coffee drinkers -- it has similar flavor characteristics of coffee, but does not have a bitter aftertaste.  many coffee drinkers stay away from tea because it is either weak tasting or too watery -- this is definitely not weak tea, and a splash of (whole) milk will take care of the wateriness if that\'s a problem.<br /><br />my recommendation is to buy whichever of twinings or taylors is cheapest.  buying the 6-pack is a good idea because it is freakin\' impossible to find lapsang souchang

any of the cans, which i\'ve experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. the proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it\'s not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. none of the meat was seasoned, at all. this is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. there is a mild "spam"-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that\'s why i heavily seasoned it. don\'t plan on frying anything

(stuffed animals, tennis balls, etc).  i was happy to see that this keeps him occupied for 20-30 minutes at a time and i only put one gnawhide treat on it at a time.  he usually chews the ends of the bones as well as tries to get the gnawhide off.  we have a med/lg size (seems to be the perfect size for him) and it takes him just a few minutes to get the actual gnawhide off when he is trying, the rest of the time is spent happily chewing on the ends.  my dog usually isn't interested in nylabones so i was surprised to see him chewing on this so much.<br /><br />i will agree with a couple other reviews:<br />-  white nylon bone easily gets chewed up and gets quite sharp.  he hasn't had any cuts in his mouth that i've found, but i do have to be careful when unscrewing the ends because of how sharp it is.<br />-  it's quite heavy for a toy.  my dog loves to get playful and throw toys into the air with his mouth, but this one is a little too heavy for that, and so far he hasn't shows any interest in chewing on the ball in the center.<br /><br />one more downside for me is that the treats can get expensive.  so far they are at least $0.50 per gnawhide (they were about $0.80 each at target) so if you were to use 2 treats at a time like it is meant for, that's at least a $1 a pop.  so i've resorted to using this as a special treat every couple of days instead of daily.<br /><br

the "zero carb" selling point, while true, does not justify the high price tag in my opinion. most any alfredo sauce should be low carb in the first place. the reason why most aren\'t is because the thickness in alfredo sauce comes from flour or wheat flour to give it that heartiness we\'re used to.<br /><br />this product doesn\'t contain flour so it\'s a lot thinner than traditional alfredo sauce would otherwise be and is pretty much cream, cheese, and a bunch of spices. the funny part is that alfredo sauce is typically used with pasta which is chock full of carbs so you\'re really not going to gain any "low carb" points by using a sauce that has 0 grams on a bowl of pasta that has 100 grams.<br /><br />in terms of taste? this product, like many other diet products, tastes "off." you\'d probably be able to tell it was trying to mimic alfredo sauce but you\'d know something wasn\'t quite right about it. it\'s not a bad taste but like other reviewers have said it\'s kind of a

sweet for me. i like to use 1/3 bowl of sweet cereal combined with plain corn flakes, bran flakes, grape nuts, or oat cereal. that dilutes it down to something with flavor and a little sweetness. after trying the mini-wheats with just milk, i added the plain and it was just right with a cinnamon twang. eating it straight it had the taste of a cinnamon roll. so now you can decide from there.<br

a backyard with space to plant, i plant seeds in soil. it takes about 4 months to complete their life cycle. during their growth, i only pick off tips of the leaves so they could still continue to grow. only the last few days of seed maturing the leaves turn dry and yellow and are not edible. in return, i could get seeds "for free" to plant right away, as long as the weather allows it.<br />i don\'t use any pest control or use any fertilizer, so certainly not all of the seeds would survive. aphids, with the help of ants, and snails do invade, and a slight strong gust could break their fragile stems. however, i could be sure that they are certainly organic through out the process. and the source of grass would not die down during the months they grow.<br /><br />notes: remember to

consumer of dark chocolates while i tend to prefer milk chocolate, and/or chocolates with fillings. after trying it out, we both decided that we would not purchase this product in the future, though for different reasons. here are our independent reviews:<br /><br />my wife: i am confused by the labeling of this product. it is called a 'dark chocolate' but has a 54% cacao content. most dark chocolates that i buy have upwards of 65% - 75% cacao. when i first opened the package, i noticed a smoky aroma. i eat a lot of dark chocolate, including raw chocolate, but i never noticed such a smoky aroma before and found it pleasant. my first bite was disappointing. it is a bit too sweet for me, and is certainly significantly sweeter than the dark chocolates that i buy. it is smooth, which i like. while i appreciate the fact that newman's own is producing an organic, minimally processed, chocolate i will not purchase this again.<br /><br />me: from my first bite i knew that this chocolate was not for me. it had a distinctly waxy feel that i usually associate with inferior chocolates - this was an immediate turnoff. there was absolutely nothing distinctive about this chocolate - no fruity notes, no particular bitterness, nothing that sticks out. while this chocolate is better than a lot of what constitutes the mass market, i cannot recommend it.", 'i like the test and

many grains (mostly rice or wheat, but also things like quinoa or soba) and in many textures. the reviews that say the texture is horrible are probably from people accustomed only to white semolina italian-american pasta. no, this does not taste like the spaghetti you get from cosco. it is also not the processed white flour maruchen ramen that many americans know as their only representation of asian noodles. the texture is just like cellophane noodles, which are used frequently in thai and vietnamese food. if you are not sure if you will like the texture go to your local vietnamese enclave and have a bowl of pho. those transparent noodles with a little bit of "bite" or "crunch" almost to them? that\'s what these are. not slimy or slippery like semolina pasta. they don\'t just dissolve and break when you slurp them, you actually have to bite them off. they abosrb broth really well - try yours in a beef broth with roast slice beef and cilantro, green onions, lime and bean sprouts. use plenty of garlic and hot chili. you won\'t miss a thing!<br /><br />no unnatural ingredients, high fiber and no calories! this solved two of my dietary inefficiencies with one stone - needing to add fiber supplements to my yogurt and smoothies, and the empty calories in noodle soup. now i can have a big bowl of protein, veggies, broth and fiber with no empty processed carbs in the way! i\'ll be saving my carbs for important things like fruit... and chocolate :><br /><br />post script: for the people who insist the noodles "smell like fish," or "smell like rotting," i would like you to try a little cultural sensitivity experiment, and go to your local korean, vietnamese, japanese, thai, or chinese marketplace, and take a big deep breath. smell that?<br /><br />it\'s fish. actual, came-from-the-ocean fish. it might be fresh like sashimi or it might be dried, smoked, or pickled, depending on what flavor of asian store you stumbled into. we eat them, you know, in forms other than breaded and deep fried. now go smell something like kim chee, miso, or 100-year eggs. that smell is known as fermentation. say it with me, fer-men-ta-shun. that is not the same as rotten. it is a deliberate conversion of carbohydrates to alcohol under anaerobic conditions utilized for change in flavor, texture, and quality. you may discover parallels in your nice normal people foods like cheese and beer.<br /><br />before you rail on about how disgusting this product is because in your ignorance you dumped salt-free marinara on it (ew) consider trying to find one of us slanty-eyed

apparently cooking destroys the benefit according to what i read about flaxseed oils. add it to the soup around when you add cheese or croutons<br /><br />- sauces and chutneys. indian cilantro or mint chutney can hold a lot of flaxseed meal without its taste being affected. likewise for hot sauces, salsas and so on.<br /><br />- waffles. the flaxseed meal becomes a kind of solid fat that enrichens the waffle. i add it to regular, chocolate, or oatmeal flour waffles. yes, the waffle maker may affect the flaxseed meal directly in contact with the hot plates, but the rest of the fsm is not exposed to as much heat.<br /><br />- as they suggest, breads of all kinds.<br /><br />- if you're grilling a cheese sandwich, might as well up the fiber content and get whatever omega-3's as you can salvage. stick it in the cheese.<br /><br />- believe it or don't it incorporates into nachos and pizzas too. if that's all your kid eats, maybe a flaxseed meal infusion will help (but do fix the food habits, fsm is not a fix-all)<br /><br />don't:<br /><br />- try to eat it plain, i tried it, and it's about as disgusting as trying to drink vegetable oil, plus it has fiber<br /><br />- add it to stuff that is still cooking. no benefit, the fat changes to regular unhealthy omega-6 with the high heat from contacting the pan surface<br /><br />- overdo adding fsm to stuff. i tried to push the envelope, and if you overdo it, the food tastes slick and even a bit soapy, kind of like it's gone bad.<br /><br />- add it to clear liquids or foods. sounds obvious, but once you feel a benefit (it

and was pleased to see heinz changed over to getting rid of hfcs. i can now buy ketchup again from costco.  the only thing better then this is organic .<br /><br />hfcs here's why it's far more dangerous to your health than table sugar<br /><br />high fructose corn syrup is a popular sweetener because it is chemically different from sugar ,it has a longer shelf life and mixes better into beverages. yet the corn industry likes to downplay these differences, pointing out that sugar is 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose, while hfcs is 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.<br /><br />this framing glosses over an essential difference: sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide composed of a single glucose molecule and a single fructose molecule. hfcs, in contrast, is a liquid solution composed of separated individual glucose and fructose molecules (monosaccharides).<br /><br />to make hfcs, a 100 percent glucose solution is converted via enzymes into a 42 percent fructose-58 percent glucose solution. this solution is further treated until it is 90 percent glucose, then mixed with more 42-58 solution to yield a 55-45 concentration. so while the final ratio of fructose to glucose might look similar to table sugar, it is in fact a very different product. is it any wonder that hfcs is processed differently by the body?", 'although this is supposedly a

several reasons.<br /><br />first, yes, it's hot. but it's hot for hot's sake: the sauce is really just a heat delivery system, without really bringing anything to the party in terms of flavor. it smells like it should have some of the smoky sweetness of a good jolokia sauce, but if you can actually pick up any distinctive flavors behind the wall of heat it generates in your mouth i'd be surprised.<br /><br />second, the texture of this sauce is just off. i know dave's sauces tend to be thicker than most, but this is practically a paste. the thickness causes two major problems. the sauce is difficult to dose out, tending to either catch in the bottle's neck or plop out in large dollops well beyond what any reasonable person would want. also, it's hard to distribute across your food.<br /><br />third, it's impractical. something this hot and thick is far more useful as an ingredient than a condiment, but even when i'm making spicy food i seldom have need for anything this potent. i can't imagine using it on a slice of pizza or in scrambled eggs.<br /><br />sauces like holy jolokia and naga soreass will let you experience the subtle flavors that come with the intense heat of the pepper. dave's ghost pepper just gives the heat, without really showcasing the pepper itself.<br /><br />get it for when you make large pots of chili or when you want to haze fraternity

ran. with no watery juice, the crust did not turn into a layer of purple mush; instead it remained a distinctly separate layer of flakey goodness.  the vacant spots left on the pie plate after

and alligator.", 'lee kum kee premium oyster sauce is considered to be the best tasting oyster sauce by far (by industry insiders and consumers). this is the original, truly. the lee family literally invented oyster sauce. grandpa lee was making oyster soup and accidentally cooked it down to a thick liquid and that\'s how it was invented (its main ingredient is concentrated slow cooked oysters). oyster sauce is a must-have condiment for cooking nearly every one of today\'s chinese & cantonese food dishes (that have sauce) and for a good reason. it imparts a unique flavor that can\'t be imitated by any other flavoring or condiment. not sure what they used before this was invented more than 120 years ago, but we\'re sure glad they use it now.<br /><br />be careful when purchasing, if you want this exact sauce. lee kum kee makes at least 9 or 10 types of oyster sauce, but this is the best one they make, their "premium" oyster sauce. still, i wonder why it\'s so expensive, since they have the power to buy oysters relatively cheaply by the millions and have already perfected the way it\'s made, getting it down to a science that for them is surely simple to do since they\'ve been doing it for so long. why so expensive. i imagine they charge so much because they can, since they have such a great rep for the best flavor.<br /><br />they make a darn good hoisin sauce too, plus over 200 other types of sauces.<br /><br />the main headquarters of lee kum kee is located in hong kong and has production bases in xinhui, huangpu, hong kong, malaysia, and los angeles. so those customers in america who don\'t like to buy imports, not to worry, chances are if you buy from a store in america you\'re getting the product that was made right here in california.<br /><br />having said all that, it looses one star for having msg in its ingredients. i\'m also not happy that the price is so high (higher than other brands, no matter where you buy it). i always wonder, how would it taste without the msg and caramel color. the color is naturally brown, so i don\'t see why coloring is needed. and salt is already a great flavor enhancer so i wonder why add msg. i\'m still searching for a great tasting oyster sauce with no msg (and not so expensive) but haven\'t found one yet. when i do i\'ll be sure to post that info here for you all.<br /><br />ingredients: oyster extractives,

assume, thought i needed every cool baby-specific gadget available so i was really excited to get my baby brezza and really enjoyed using it at first.  making baby food with the brezza is just as simple as they say, it is nice to just turn the machine on and let it go to work.  after a month of making my son's food though, it broke.  mind you, i was making larger batches, so it broke on only the second day i actually used it.  after the brezza broke, i learned a lot.<br /><br />my advice it use the tools you already have in your kitchen and you'll be much happier.  the ease of the baby brezza was great, but if you're making large batches of food you'll end up spending your entire day on it because you can only cook a small amount of food at a time with it.  instead, set up a large stock pot with a few cups of water, boil the water and set your veggies/fruits in a colander above the water (resting on the rim of the stock pot), and cover the colander.  let the food steam for a few minutes until tender, then pour it into a blender or food processor.  this way you can cook large amounts of food and quickly move through everything you need to steam.  this solution is much

this coffee's packaging, but the important part first: it tastes good. fog chaser is a little more robust than i like for a morning blend (i tend toward a dunkin donuts style coffee first thing in the am), but is perfect for afternoon or evening. the nonstandard pods fit into my b70 and while there has been occasional sediment, it's not been a problem with the majority of my 36-pod pack; at least, not as bad as (say) grove square. yes, i'd buy these again.<br /><br />now the negatives. as has been stated, the pods aren't plastic cups with embedded filters, sealed by a foil cover, but rather filter pouches with a plastic ring and foil cover. there's no need to punch a drain hole in the plastic cup, since there isn't one. i've heard concerns about the keurig success causing more spent k-cups to be dumped in trash tips and landfills; i'd also guess that the construction makes it a non-trivial recycling task. so a redesign with less plastic would seem like a good thing.<br /><br />however, one of the charms of keurig is that the cup is packed in a relatively inert gas: i've heard nitrogen, which would make sense. oxygen is the enemy of coffee. old coffee goes stale because it oxidizes. keeping air away from coffee keeps it fresh... but the coffee in the san francisco bay coffee company's packaging hasn't this feature. the bags (containing twelve pods each) are heavy-duty plastic with a metal button of unknown purpose, and perhaps those bags are filled with something other than oxygen... but as soon as you take them out, the coffee begins to deteriorate.<br /><br />not that this happens in a matter of seconds, or even days. after all, keeping the lid on a pound can of coffee (i can actually remember when a pound was sixteen ounces, not 13.5) kept the coffee fresh enough, assuming you were a regular drinker. if you use a ziploc bag to store the unused pods from an opened bag, i'm sure that they'll stay fresh enough in the week or two that the bag lasts.<br /><br />my concern, though, is for occasional coffee drinkers, for whom the keurig system is a godsend. for example, i dated a woman who hated coffee, but wanted me to have some when i visited. having fresh coffee in an inert storage container would have been great. these, though, might go bad in between my visits to her house.<br /><br />so in conclusion, go ahead and buy these if you're a frequent coffee drinker who will finish a whole 12-pod bag in less than a month. keep a couple of ziploc bags (sandwich bags hold 6) for storage. companies that go through a whole lot of k-cups ought really to like these, especially since they're about 10% under the cost of most k-cups.", "this candy tasted good. a real honey flavor. the ingredients don't state much honey though, mainly sugar. i

could get my hands on, i decided that this is still the best choice for us. if there is no regulation on something, you cannot just pick out one or two items, test them and scare the nation. you need to see what is in everything else as well and test comparable brands for safety in their ingredients too! personally i feel a lot safer giving this formula to my child, a company that has not had any incident reports (that i know of) since they have been around, then give my baby a formula that children have gotten sick on and one recently died from. be it contamination or ingredients.<br /><br

can. even removing as much bpa from packaging as they can, and giving options to parents to choose what to give their babies.<br /><br />i hope this formula will continue to be available and that this issue can be rectified quickly through more testing.<br /><br />update: i just checked their website and they have further testing that has been done, stating that this formula is safe and levels are

thought mixing the potassium chloride with sodium chloride (regular salt) would make it palatable.<br /><br />there is room for improvement.  for example, i\'d love it if this stuff came in different ratios.  you get used to 1/3 sodium chloride then, after a few months, lower it to like 10%.  who knows how much real salt needs to be in there to make it bearable (5%? less).  also, a healthy dose of magnesium would be nice.  magnesium deficiency is one of the major players in high blood pressure and pain in the rear to supplement.<br /><br />but let\'s not get sidetracked here.  the bottom line

 highly recommended!  however, if you truly do suffer from the common fungal cause of serious flakes, you will need to eradicate the cause with a product like nizoral and perhaps discuss it with your primary care physician as well.  if your scalp is merely dried out from too frequent washing, this is a nice mild shampoo when used in moderation.  it works well and you may find that soon you can even skip shampooing to every other day and merely rinsing your hair clean of common pollutants, dirt and sweat that build up during the day and saving a good washing for the second day.  when my husband first noticed his scalp was overly dry, limiting his shampooing to every other day was the recommendation he got from his doctor.  however, he finds this shampoo, used in small amounts, gets the job done without stripping his hair.  he also now uses their conditioner.<br /><br />i used the shampoo on my own long hair "ethnic hair" but found i was better off sticking to the same company\'s new clear scalp & hair beauty line of nourishing products for women of color or even fair skinned women who simply have textured, dry hair and dry scalp  in need of proper nourishment and moisture protection such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b007rtr9e2">clear scalp & hair beauty ultra shea smooth & nourish conditioner, 12.7 fluid ounce</a> and the shampoo and nourishing hair oil that goes with it.  clear and all its products are passing muster in our household!

diamond pet foods (maker of taste of the wild) and confirmed that their "ocean fish meal" indeed comes from the gulf of mexico.  i then did my own research and confirmed online that today (april 2012) there are major concerns with the fish and seafood coming from the gulf.  fish are showing up with black and bright red \'lesions\' and crustaceans are showing up with blackened body parts.  this was in some video taken by a journalist and posted on the web.<br /><br />if you watch the big fix you\'ll learn not only about the oil that is likely sitting on the bottom of the gulf, but you\'ll also learn about toxic chemical dispersant branded as corexit, which has been used extensively in the gulf to hide the oil.  this is what\'s really going on with the fish in the gulf and you can probably assume that pet food is considered a great way to "dispose" of food products within the commerce chain.<br /><br />i\'m stopping feeding my pet this food immediately because despite what the bag depicts (wolves and bears in the wild) one of the major ingredients ("ocean fish meal") doesn\'t come from the pacific northwest at all, but actually comes from the gulf of mexico which is a suspect

market imitators. first of all, syrup shouldn\'t run, it should ooze. real maple syrup runs. the mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. it has viscosity. so instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. and the taste: mass-market syrup is sweet.  real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. which is authentic, sure. but bark is authentic.  is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?"<br /><br />i couldn\'t have said it better. i\'ll give it two stars instead of one because we did

cooking:<br /><br />here\'s how real maple syrups differ from each other...<br /><br />grade a light amber or vermont fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. it\'s often used for maple candies.<br /><br />grade a medium amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. it\'s typically used for pancakes and waffles.<br /><br />grade a dark amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. it can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking.<br /><br />grade b is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly

allergy on one of my cats.  finally after reading on a website (i'm sorry i don't remember which one), someone mentioned this food and i found it at my local farm and home store (like a southern states feed store).  i was really skeptical that this would work, but i was hopeful because the front of the bag said no wheat, corn or soy, plus it contains omega 3 fatty acids.  imagine my surprise when after one bag of this food, my cat's long-time allergy where he licked all the hair off his belly and caused little sores all over began to clear up.  for the first time since he was a kitten he has hair on his belly that is not the result of me breaking down and taking him to the vet for a cortisone shot - something i tried not to do often because it is not good for cats and can cause diabetes.  in addition to my main concern for getting my poor kitty feeling better, i was paying so much money for prescription zd diet from the vet's office and with five cats i had to isolate one cat to feed him while the others got the less expensive store brand.  anyway - i'm just saying - after trying everything i could think of - homepathic remedies, $$$ trips to vet, $$$ trips to cat dermatologist, and many $65 bags of zd diet, this wonderful food has stopped the allergy and its lower cost means i can allow all five of my cats to eat it.  i know all allergies are different, but this belly licking behavior seems to be very common if the websites and comments i saw while research the problem are any indication.  try this food - give it at least a full month before deciding if it works.  i am so thankful to have found this food.", 'tried hard to like the henry and lisa\'s salmon, but could not.  often found small "glass like" particles that crunched in the salmon.  henry

filled the same. yet, the batter expanded and spilled out when it was cooking, then while they cooled they flattened out with a concave dip in the center. the next morning i tried to frost them, but they were so sticky that dark, cupcake sludge stuck to the frosting. we're not talking heavy frosting either, a light whip cream frosting. when they were served, no one ate more than a single bite and put them down. usually the kids (4-8 years old) will eat anything sweet, but they all spit it out on their plates. the adults were polite enough to swallow. the final texture was a slippery sweet

is excellent for bakeries and cinnamon rolls though!<br />i also made some gingerbread cake and the korintje cinnamon is what made mine tastes just like the whole foods market's famous gingerbread sold at their bakeries. when compared to mccormick's cinnamon, i could taste a significant difference. mccormick's tastes more flat and dull, which may be good for meat or recipes where you want only a light cinnamon flavor (like pho). frontier's korintje cinnamon tastes sharp and stingy, with a strong fragrance.", 'many years ago (at least 10 years, maybe more) i remember eating emerald honey roasted nuts on an airplane and i was thrilled and actually excited about the taste. it came in a little plastic bag. i raved to all my family and friends how great they tasted - just the right amount of salty and sweet.<br /><br />i\'m eating some right now, not thrilled. could just as easily be some generic brand, hardly any sweet at all. i bought this canister at a local supermarket.<br /><br />if you\'re into reusing or recycling plastic containers there\'s good and bad here. if you want to reuse the container you can remove the entire label and you have a tall dark green plastic containers with a screw on lid - the only marking is an impression on the top of the lid that says emerald.<br /><br />problem is, the top is number 5 plastic and the bottom is number 7. number 7 is the most unhealthy and hardest to recycle plastic there is so you don\'t want to reuse this for food and your local area might not accept it for recycling. you can use it for nuts & bolts maybe in the garage? but in my opinion it shouldn\'t be used for these nuts, or any food. number 7 shouldn\'t be used at all, ever, should be illegal. gases leach off of it and into the food and into the air.....<br /><br />i think i\'m going to throw these out now. i got them on sale so it\'s not too much of a waste. i just realized they use #7 plastic as i was writing this. had i realized before, i would not have bought them. i\'m going to pay more attention in the future when buying things in plastic jars.<br /><br />~<br /><br />plastic #1: this is polyethylene terephtalate, also known as pete or pet.  most disposable soda and water bottles are made of #1 plastic, and it\'s usually clear. this plastic is considered generally safe. however, it is known to have a porous surface that allows bacteria and flavor to accumulate, so it is best not to keep reusing these bottles as makeshift containers. this plastic is picked up by most curbside recycling programs.<br /><br />plastic #2: this is high density polyethylene, or hdpe.  most milk jugs, detergent bottles, juice bottles, butter tubs, and toiletries bottles are made of this.  it is usually opaque. this plastic is considered safe and has low risk of leaching. it is also picked up by most recycling programs.<br /><br />plastic #3: this is polyvinyl chloride, or pvc. it is used to make food wrap, bottles for cooking oil, and plumbing pipes. pvc is a tough plastic but it is not considered safe to cook food near it. there are phthalates in this material-softening chemicals that interfere with hormonal development. you should minimize use of #3 plastic around food as much as possible. never cook using food wrap, especially in a microwave oven. if the wrap is listed as microwave-safe then i would still not let it touch the food while using it in the microwave. #3 plastic is rarely accepted by recycling programs.<br /><br />plastic #4: this is low density polyethylene (ldpe). it is used to make grocery bags, some food wraps, squeezable bottles, and bread bags. this plastic is considered safe, but is unfortunately not often accepted by curbside recycling programs.<br /><br />plastic #5: this is polypropylene. yogurt cups and similar wide-necked containers are often made from it, as well as water bottles with a cloudy finish. you\'ll also find it in medicine bottles, ketchup and syrup bottles, and straws. this plastic is also considered safe, and is increasingly being accepted by curbside recycling programs.<br /><br />plastic #6: this is polystyrene, or styrofoam, from which disposable containers and packaging are made. you\'ll also find it in disposable plates and cups. evidence is increasingly suggesting that this type of plastic leaches potentially toxic chemicals, especially when heated. i suggest avoiding the use of #6 plastic as much as possible. it is difficult to recycle and most recycling programs won\'t accept it.<br /><br />plastic #7: this number basically means "everything else." it\'s a mixed bag, composed of plastics which were invented after 1987.  polycarbonate falls into this category, including the dreaded bpa. so do modern plastics used in anything from ipods to computer cases. it also includes some baby bottles and food storage containers which resist staining. use of #7 plastic is at your own risk, since you don\'t know what could be in it. you should dispose of any food or drink related product, especially for children, that is known to contain bpa. i personally also view any other food or drink container made from #7 plastic with a good deal of suspicion. it is difficult to recycle #7 plastic and most curbside recycling programs won\'t accept it.<br /><br />to summarize, plastics #2, #4 and #5 are generally considered safe. plastic #1 is safe too but should not be re-used due to the risk of growing bacteria. any other plastic should be used with extreme caution, especially around food or drink. the risk is even greater when heating food. for microwaving in particular, remember that microwave safe containers aren\'t necessarily healthy. they just won\'t melt. in general, it\'s better to avoid microwaving plastic entirely and stick to glass.', 'ok, who in their right mind would pay this much money for cocktail cherries?  me!<br />seriously, these are most flavorful maraschino

fellow parents. i have been trying to make a decision on an organic formula (weighing the pros and cons of earth's best and baby's only) and i have done weeks of research, i have read the cornucopia reports, combed clinical studies i could find on the internet regarding dha/ara, websites of all the major formaula manufacturer's, research on hexane, etc, etc, and i finally talked to my pediatrician. here is a summary of what i found:<br /><br />earth's best:<br />major pro: milk-based. my pediatrician was adamant that the first ingredient in an infant formula should be milk. despite opinions i've seen out there about the composition of carbs - lactose and other sugars - in breast milk and its similarity to composition in baby's only, there is no doubt that formula should be milk-based. all forms of syrup - whether it is corn syrup or brown rice syrup are sugars, and not suitable substitutes for lactose. these sugars can not only lead to problems with obesity and diabetes later in life, but the lack of lactose does not sufficiently meet an infant's nutritional needs.<br /><br />major con: hexane-derived dha. by the way, it's not just the organic formulas that have this controversial method of dha/ara extraction. every formula on the market - organic and non-organic has dha derived in this way. i called every formula manufacturer to verify this. (martek's lifedha is also white-labeled - so you dont always know that it is martek. but if there is dha/ara added to an infant formula or food, whether it is labeled or not, it is almost always going to be from martek)<br /><br />baby's only:<br />major pro: no dha/ara - it is the only formula on the market i can find without dha/ara - if anyone else can find another formula, organic or non-organic, let me know! i have literally scoured the marketplace. the only place to find it is canada (nestle good start) and it's not easy to purchase and ship to the u.s.<br /><br />major con: my pediatrician confirmed that brown rice syrup as a first ingredient in an infant formula is not acceptable. she says while nature's one may market it as better because it doesn't spike insulin levels, at the end of the day it is still sugar, just a different form of corn syrup. she was very concerned that nutritionally this is not suitable for an infant. the other con of baby's only is that it is indeed a toddler formula. when you compare the mineral values you will see for example that the levels of calcium, phosphorous, iodine and a few others are much higher than in other infant formulas. in fact their vitamin/mineral content is more comparable to other toddler formulas on the market, like good start 2. i have researched that the higher mineral content could make an infant's kidney system work harder. not sure of long-term effects, if any. this was outside of my research.<br /><br />bottom line: i know that many proponents of baby's only will say that the company is taking a political stance, in fact it does encourage breastfeeding until 12 months, but it also discourages the introduction of dairy milk at 12 months, which really goes against the apa recommendation to introduce dairy milk at 12 months. i have no doubt that baby's only is meant for toddlers, in fact they tell you to consult a physician if you're offering it to an infant under 12 months. they don't do this for pc reasons, they are a company that cares about revenues, just like all the other formula companies. they say this because it is indeed a toddler formula meant for babies 12 months +<br /><br />there is no perfect solution out there. but i've decided to continue my hunt for a milk-based formula without dha/ara, whether organic or non-organic. in the meantime, i can only do what all other parents do - make the best choice having weighed the pros and cons. i choose earth's best. why? because i've done enough research to feel confident that the likelihood of hexane solvent remaining in formula is highly unlikely. my research, which includes talking to a scientist that uses hexane in his laboratory, indicates that hexane is highly volatile and evaporates almost immediately. in other words, by the time it has extracted the oils, it should have evaporated. while you can never be 100% sure of anything in this world, the independent studies do show that no traces of hexane are in the formula). i know it's hard to believe everything you read, so i am only sharing all of this information because i feel it would be wasted if i kept it all to myself! at the end of the day, i feel the nutritional benefit of a milk-based formula outweighs the very small (perhaps non-existent) chance of hexane traces in formula.<br /><br />i hope this helps!", 'i don\'t enjoy this blend much, but as another reviewer mentioned perhaps it needs a melitta coffee maker for it\'s full potential.<br /><br />i\'ve made 3 pots:<br /><br />first i followed the instructions (2 level teaspoons per 6 ounces). i got brown colored water.<br /><br />then i doubled it. tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned brand.<br /><br />finally i filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. that produced the best results, but i still just wasn\'t thrilled with the flavor.<br /><br />so you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, i normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn\'t the issue. i do normally grind my own, but again pre-ground won\'t cause that big of a difference. my preferred daily coffee is safeway house brand medium roast colombian, but lately due to finances i\'ve been drinking a dollar store brand called "eight o\'clock" that\'s of similar (though different) quality to the melitta.<br /><br />my suggestion is if you\'d like a quality coffee in this price range look at seattle\'s best (starbucks milder step child) or if you have a safeway their house brand beans are quite good.<br /><br />edit: i compared the melitta today with a similar millstone (medium roast colombian supremo). the millstone was much better.', "you're better off buying a powder and making your own tea. these tea bags are overpriced, not to mention that all of the reviews are bogus, and more than likely from the people working for or related to the manufacturer. just check their other reviews (if there are any).<br /><br />chaga is a potent mushroom, but get the real deal and make sure it's organic.", "i've submitted this review once before, and it appears to have been deleted.  even odder, the description of the product has been changed to make it even more misleading.<br /><br />this is not a 5 lb bag, it is a 2.5 lb bag, which means you're paying twice as much per ounce as you should.  this is a comparable price for the 5 lb bag.  the seller needs to change both the description and the picture, otherwise they're going to keep cheating customers.<br /><br />all of that is a shame, really, because this is a very high quality food that my cats love. i recommend this kibble highly.", "i have frizzy hair. it's wavy not curly. i've used many serums to contain it.  this hair oil is greasy on my hands but not in my hair.  it has left it smooth and shiney.  i didn't have that product build up residue or greasy look after application.", 'i already have a wild lust for this product, so getting a box full was about as good as it can get - unless the box was bigger!!!!!!!', 'when i read that these were "long lasting" i was hoping for a chew that would take my take more than 2 minutes for my 9 month old chocolate lab and 9 year old lab to chew. not happy with this nylabone purchase!', 'not the best ... too many small pieces and no enough full popcorn to enjoy.', 'the bulgur wheat was of good--not great--quality. and the price was excellent. however, the product had a hard rock-like substance in it and i cracked a crown. i detected the hard stuff in the product more than once.', "nothing aggravates me more when you pick up a quick snack at a health food store assuming it's healthy due to the nutrition facts, only to find out later this little bar is actually 2 servings - hugely misleading packaging!

i have been feeding the chicken & pea l.i.d to my cats for months now & they have been doing great off of it as you can see from my previous review on this product. then, in mid february 2012, i opened a new bag for my cats and the coloring of the crunchies were a much darker color than they used to be & my cats wouldn't even eat it! so i went and purchased a new bag from a different store to see if the 1st bag was just a bad batch & this time the crunchies looked normal, however within a week, one of my cats got blood covered stool (which took 3 months to go away!), and my cat with the sensitive stomach started acting mopey & sick. after 2 weeks he would barely walk around. several tests later the vet found that his intestines were swollen along with his stomach lymph nodes & he had developed pancreatitis. he's off the food now but still recouping. apparently my cat isn't the only one with problems recently with the limited ingredient dry crunchies according to reviews on consumeraffairs.com! customers on there have the same complaints with the cat & dog dry l.i.d food over the past few months of it doing the same thing to their animals too! natural balance doesn't have my business any more, that is until they no longer have diamond pet foods package their products. after doing some background research on natural balance, diamond pet foods (who packages for them) has constant recalls & complaints. they have one going on right now actually & were one of the biggest culprits during the 2007 major pet food recall.  just keep an eye on your pets if you purchase this, and also watch for a runny nose or sneezing, my cat no longer does either since taking him off of this food.<br /><br />original review:<br />five stars!!!! one of my cats has a very sensitive stomach but does very well on these crunchies! and my other cat had bad dandruff but after a couple of months on this food its completely gone! her coat looks beautiful and she doesn't frantically lick her back anymore! both of my cats seemed to prefer this flavor over the salmon l.i.d but all cats are different. so glad natural balance makes this!", 'i have never tried any of the newman\'s own products, but had heard the products from this label were of high quality.  i was therefore eager to try newman\'s own organics ginger snaps.  my wife has always loved ginger snaps.  i like them, but have never been overwhelmed by them.  the first thing i liked about the cookie was its size.  very often, you don\'t want a regular-size cookie.  the newman\'s own cookies are small -- not quite edible in a single bite.  the size makes it possible to gauge your cookie intake to appetite without waste.<br /><br />the cookies are crisp and literally break off with an audible "snap."  they remained crisp and fresh in their bag for well over a week.  the flavor is very ginger-y and leaves a nice tingling aftertaste in your mouth.  my wife was especially pleased at the flavor, since she\'s a longtime fan of ginger snaps.  i asked her if she\'d say the newman\'s own were the best ginger snaps she\'d ever tasted.  she pondered a moment or two and then said, "yes, definitely."  high praise indeed.<br /><br />as for myself, i enjoyed the small cookies with coffee after dinner.  they alleviate that sugar craving while not putting on the pounds.  they\'re a sensible dessert, if eaten in moderation.  these cookies are very fine examples of what a classic ginger snap should be.  the company has concentrated on natural ingredients and care in baking rather than masking the flavor with unnecessary icing or adornment with other toppings.', "most bbq competition teams have this rub in their arsenal, and you should too. it's just as advertised: designed for chicken, but made for pork. i'm a big fan.", 'read through the other reviews and you will find the same situation i had with the creamers.  it does not arrive in the blue dispenser box that is shown, the 192 creamers arrive loose inside a cardboard box with no padding.  perhaps less creamers would burst during transit if the display box shown was wrapped inside a cardboard box.  the box arrived completely undamaged on the outside. none appeared to have frozen during transit, it appears that the creamer singles pop during high altitude transit or perhaps when the box is thrown by the shipper or pressure is placed on the box.  it is a sticky mess when it arrives.  the creamer taste and convenience is great, but it is unfortunate that so many people have commented on this problem and interational delight has not fixed its packaging and shipping issue.', 'according to the fda, the reason for the recall was:<br />"the firm decided to recall the wheat flour products they repack that do not declare "wheat" on the finished product labels."

splenda, the aftertaste seemed very pronounced, so i was skeptical about this products hype about being much better in that regard.  i am happy to report that there is virtually no aftertaste.  what i do notice is that the sweetness still seems "too sweet" if that makes any sense.  i\'m not just talking about the amount used.  when i taste something sweetened with the product, it seems the proper sweetness initially, but it lingers.  not a complaint, but might be the source of the remaining aftertaste some people report.  i couldn\'t be happier with this product as it has not carbs, which i am trying to avoid.  i am still unsure about artificial sweeteners in general, and will only use a drop or two of this product for favorite drinks.', 'this is a wonderful example of how a responsible

chow and haven\'t had any dry heaving at night since even though he is fed the exact same amount, at the same time of day as when we had him on purina. of course i am not an expert, but i think that purina puppy chow did not have the right nutrients for our puppy. it did bulk him up, a little too much according to the vet, but didn\'t have enough calories to really sustain him, especially at night. i am giving this two stars because i could tell our puppy loved the taste of the food and it didn\'t give him gas like his current food does.', 'well seems like people either love or hate the

you would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. the biggest concern i have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. the problem is entirely with the oil they are using. coconut oil. they list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. i asked great northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. they refused. it tastes just as good to me

a bagel, wanted something with whole grain, and i was, well, being lazy. i really wanted a bagel but i didn\'t feel like going to a bagel shop. i was already in the grocery store, walking through the bread isle, so it was an impulse buy pure and simple. in short, i was extremely disappointed. for my full review, see below.<br /><br />i have to think the only reasons anyone would give this product a good rating is either because they\'ve never eaten a real bagel or they\'re in denial and are allowing themselves to think it\'s good because they\'re so desperate for a way to eat what they think is a bagel and still feel like they\'re eating healthy. well, it\'s not a "real" bagel (not even close) and it\'s not even healthy. why do i say this?<br /><br />~<br /><br />not a real bagel:<br /><br />the only similarities between thomas\' bagels (or bagel thins) and real bagels is the round shape and the whole in the middle. other than that these so-called bagels are nothing more than fluffy bread shaped like  a bagel. upon close inspection and taste-testing it looks, tastes, and feels just like regular bread. it\'s extremely bland, even with the "whole wheat" it supposedly includes. i\'m from an area of the country that makes real bagels (nyc and surrounding area) so i know what i speak of.<br /><br />true, traditional bagels should not be whole wheat, but i have eaten a whole wheat bagel made in a real bagel shop and these aren\'t even close to a real bagel. i\'ve been eating true bagels made by hand for over 50 years. when you compare these things to real bagels it\'s almost a joke to call these things bagels.<br /><br />bagels should be dense, chewy, and stiff. this is not. this is a limp, soft piece of floppy fluffy bread. i could ball one up in my hand like wonder bread, that\'s how fluffy and soft they are. and bagels should be crispy when toasted. this is not, unless you over toast it to the point it\'s nearly burnt.<br /><br />~<br /><br />not healthy:<br /><br />one of the reasons i bought these specific "bagels" was for the whole wheat. i thought it would be healthier than a regular bagel. wrong! it contains stuff in it that i\'ve never even heard of before and i\'m sure are not "healthy" or wholesome ingredients. like datem - what the heck is datem? it also contains stuff that shouldn\'t be in a bagel.<br /><br />~<br /><br />ingredients:<br /><br />basic bagels should contain wheat flour, salt, water, and yeast leavening. that\'s it!<br /><br />real bagels contain:<br />wheat flour<br />salt<br />water<br />yeast<br /><br />thomas\' contains:<br />wheat flour<br />water<br />sugar<br />wheat gluten<br />flaked wheat<br />cellulouse fiber<br />cornmeal<br />yeast<br />wheat bran<br />salt<br />preservatives (calcium propionate, sorbic acid)<br />monoglycerides<br />guar gum<br />sodium stearoyl lactylate<br />datem<br />soybean oil<br />soy flour<br /><br />now, i do realize some of the non-traditional ingredients found in these "bagels" are there because they are supposed to be a "whole wheat" product (traditional bagels are not whole wheat), but that does not excuse the cornmeal, guar gum, datem, soy flour, soy oil, sodium stearoyl lactylate, monoglycerides, calcium propionate, and sorbic acid.<br /><br />~<br /><br />bottom line:<br /><br />if you want a bagel go to a bagel shop. if you live in an area where they are not made (or not made correctly) i suggest you make friends with someone in ny and ask them to send you a box of bagels. even if you freeze them and eat them later they\'ll taste 100% better than any grocery store bagel i\'m sure.<br /><br />i\'ll most likely get myself some real bagels from a real bagel shop in the near future, and when i do i\'ll post photos or a video that shows the difference - which will tell you a lot because these things are so bad you can tell just from a photo, you don\'t even have to taste them (although i did).', "i purchased this coffee

right guard sticks of chalk, this is not chalky or dry and leaves absolutely zero stains on your clothes (i\'ve had huge problems with right guard staining my shirts). it\'s a solid stick, so it goes on evenly, but it\'s clear, so you can\'t see it on your armpit, even immediately after putting it on (making it good for applying in public, as well).<br /><br />degree has the best scents, most of them (including the "arctic edge" scent that i chose) having a "shower fresh" smell, like a bar of irish spring soap. it also feels cool (temperature-wise) to apply, but in a very pleasant way (not ticklishly cold like some gels are). even when you haven\'t just taken a shower, it almost feels and smells like you have after you put this on.<br /><br />another standard degree feature is that the entire bottom centimeter of the package rotates to advance the stick (rather than just a small ring in the center), making it easier on the fingers (great for arthritis, i would imagine).<br /><br

it out of the shipping box, opened the lid of the cake box just to look at it, and icing was everywhere. i took a couple pics to show the company and immediately popped it in the fridge to cool down. during that time, i emailed fantasicakes to tell them about the spilled icings and suggested that more care should be taken in packaging the items.<br /><br />the response i got was interesting. they know about the hot weather and clearly they know they don\'t include icepacks. they also know how rough delivery people are with packages. offering me an extra cake with next purchase that could possibly be molded by the time it arrives? no thanks.<br /><br />again, it must also be noted that i\'m writing this review as someone who received a free cake. i have no axe to grind here. i want to give you guys an honest impression of what you will get from this company. while i thought the prices were great for a delivered cake, i can\'t take chances on sending a gift that is inadequately packaged for a perishable item and may arrive moldy. prior to receiving the cake, i intended to purchase one for all the older women in the family as "just because" gifts. not now!', "vanilla tootsie

years ago after reading a number of consumer reviews that gave it a top ranking. the one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds, who gave skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its tastes and texture. in writing this review, i went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. i\'m taking the liberty of quoting from the cookinglightly website so far as its review of creamy:<br /><br />"the roasted peanuts on the ingredient list are evident in the heady aroma and balanced flavor. testers thought this sample was a touch oily, but spread the best...makes the perfect peanut butter sandwich, but can turn into a savory dressing when mixed with soy, vinegar, and crushed red pepper to serve over sugar snap peas, broccoli, or a stir-fry. for a sweet version, mix with honey and mayonnaise and use as a fruit salad dressing. mix with chile paste with garlic (sambal oelek) or sriracha for an easy sauce for roast meats."<br /><br />this is my opinion, too, and while the above review was for the regular creamy, it applies in my opinion to the reduced fat version just as well. i love this peanut butter. i know that jif and peter pan are also often ranked highly, but skippy is by far my preference.<br /><br />while i use it on sandwiches, i often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. it is so good in this role that i gave it to a diabetic friend. she uses it in lieu of orange juice if she\'s starting to feel hypoglycemic. the peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.<br /><br />i will note that some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of reduced fat peanut butter. they have two asic points:<br /><br />1. the process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.<br /><br />2. to compensate for any loss of taste, manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.<br /><br />my rating is based on taste and texture. i\'m not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue.', 'i would love to keep ordering this product but now with increase on postage its a no go , big shame !!!!!', 'based on the favorable reviews i decided to give this a try.  the name may be "instant espresso", but

with an inexpensive cut of beef, cooked it longer than the instructions called for to tenderize the beef, and put it over rice. one thing i did was to put a little more water than called for -- 1-1/2

little unusual but i actually liked them. i like crunchy foods such as soft shell crabs. so i had no issue with the leaves. if you don't like them, take them out after cooking but before serving.<br

prepackaged by kitchens of india. i love those for the convenience, low cost, and taste ... but the prima rendang curry is significantly better tasting. i think prima is more restaurant quality whereas kitchens of india is more akin to fast food.  that's a good way to compare them.  kitchens of india is a lot cheaper but you get more product with prima and the taste is considerably better. i would not hesitate to serve prima to dinner guests but i wouldn't with kitchens of india unless it was the most casual of circumstances.<br /><br />i will definitely be buying this in the future and

product should be boycotted. who wants to buy products from companies that want to deceive you into buying an inferior or cheaply made product. they find it easier to put a token amount of splenda so they can put it on the label and you will think better of the product. i only would buy this if there was no alternative available and it was necessary due to blood sugar level control otherwise pass on it. i hate food companies that lie. even small lies. it is like a famous brand of shortening on the market that says 0 grams of trans fats on the label but in reality it is 100 percent hydrogenated oil which is trans fat. even though the entire can is only trans fat they made the serving size so small that it contains less than 1 gram of trans fat so they can put contains 0 grams trans fat on

new to the whole gf scene i wasn't quite sure what to expect, but i didn't expect the crackers to be as bad as they were.  the taste was simply awful - i can't quite place the taste other than to say that there were burnt undertones and a ton of rosemary.  i was glad to have salami to put on top of the crackers to mask their taste.  i will definitely not be buying these again.", "i know this is

$2.50 per bottle.', "i generally don't write bad product reviews, but in this case i'll make an exception. i switched from using sugar in my coffee to agave due to the low glycemic index, but also because it seemed simple to use, and the liquid is much easier to dissolve if i wanted to use it in a cooler liquid, such as iced tea. this was the first agave i ever purchased, and i am now a big fan. however, that is in spite of this xagave product, not because of it. the bottle design for this agave nectar was beyond frustrating to me. the design of the bottles included a clear plastic top, which came off completely, and a little nub with a hole on it that you pulled up so that you could squirt agave out, and then pushed back in when you were done (kind of like an old-school water bottle), and then you put the clear plastic top back on again. there is no way this design was actually tested by a conscious living human before it was putt into production. you could not use this product without leaving at least a tiny bit of agave around the spout thing every single time you used it. the next morning, you left a little more, and so on and so forth, until the top of the bottle (including the little plastic top thing) were so disgusting and sticky that i actually started to dread my normal cup of coffee every morning. i literally counted down the days until we were finished with this product (yes, i refused to waste it by throwing it out); not because i planned on quitting agave. no, only because i wanted to quit making a sticky disgusting mess every morning with my coffee. honestly, i can't believe i'm the first one to complain about this. am i the only one who received this type of dispenser top? is this some sort of elaborate agave practical joke?<br /><br />bottom line, i like agave. strongly support it. i hate this bottle. in my nightmares, a giant version of this bottle leaves sticky puddles of disgustingness that i get stuck in until the end of time. until the bottle design is changed, don't buy it. i've used other agave and it has all tasted just as good. buy one that won't frustrate you with each use.<br /><br />note: if the bottle has changed in any way, someone please comment on my review and say so, and i will change my review to reflect that. as of today (09-14-11), one of the pictures amazon is using looks like it has a different dispenser/tap than mine, while another picture shows the same tap i had on my bottles. a flip-top would basically solve all of my complaints; i switched to a different brand (wholesome sweeteners organic blue agave), and the flip-top design is perfect.", "i was drawn to this product because it contains zero amounts of sugar but the fiber count is just right too. the texture and taste are heartier than other shredded wheat products you may find down at your local wally world.<br /><br />the only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the packaging does not fully seal the food from air. within the box, the biscuits are wrapped in thin paper packaging, 6 biscuits in each of three packages, that is glued in spots along the seam (not glued continuously) and in-between the spots of glue the paper is open and not fully sealed. the packaging really comes apart when you remove a couple of the biscuits for a serving. the glue is not strong, the packaging falls apart with handling and creates the need to store the remainder of biscuits from the opened package in your tupperware. maybe these shredded wheat biscuits need to breathe but i do not think so. i have

her skin itchy causing her to scratch incessantly, pulling out fur and resulting in sore patches.  the vet had me try a very costly limited ingredient diet that would be beneficial for them both.  all of my cats did eat and tolerate the food well, but the cost was astronomical - over $30 for a 5 lb bag.<br /><br />i started reading the ingredients and nutritional contents of dozens of brands and varieties of dry food, online and at pet stores.  using customer reviews, ingredient/nutritional information and cost, i decided to try solid gold indigo moon because it was holisic, grain and gluten

20-count tea bags (pack of 6)</a>.  here are my thoughts on three peach teas:<br /><br />bigelow perfect peach:  most bigelow teas are very pleasant to drink, but this peach tea is the exception.  unbrewed, the tea smells fruity and has a particularly heavy apple smell that is accented by cinnamon.  it does not smell like peach.  when brewed, the tea smells like fruit; the peach is still not evident.  this is probably not surprising given that the first two are ingredients rose hips and hibiscus. usually, bigelow aptly names its teas but i feel this is more of a fruit tea.  unfortunately, this isn\'t even a good fruit tea.  the flavor is only memorable for its lack of good flavor.  the flavor is bitter, perhaps because of the lemon peel.  there is a strong aftertaste.  i just don\'t like this tea.  bigelow\'s peach tea is made in the usa and is caffeine free.  1-1.5 stars.<br /><br />celestial seasonings country peach passion:  celestial seasonings misses the mark with this tea.  it is a fine tea but offers nothing exceptional to want to come back to each morning.  the flavor profile is dull and lacks a distinctly peachy flavor.  when unbrewed, the scent is sweet and very much accented by orange.  when brewed, the scent does not change much; it is still quite citrus infused. this is probably not surprising given that the first ingredient is orange peel.  all in all this is a lackluster tea. flavor wise, all i could focus on was the orange.  i feel like the company should have just put more orange peel in this and made it an orange tea.  i think i would have liked that.  as the tea stands now, i am confused by it.  it is not quite an orange but it is definitely not a peach tea.  it is certainly a better peach attempt than bigelow\'s perfect pea flavor. this tea is caffeine free.  3 stars<br /><br />celestial seasonings green tea -peach blossom:  this is definitely a green tea.  the green tea scent is quite prominent when unbrewed and easily eclipses any scent that other ingredients might individually offer.  it remains a strong tea once brewed.  you really have to like green tea to appreciate this offering.  i couldn\'t really identify much peach flavoring in this  i no longer drink this tea hot due to its intense flavoring.  instead, i brew a bag, water it down, and add ice.  this creates a better version of the diet green tea you might purchase at a

tea after reading that it may help with hormonal acne (which i have yet to draw a conclusion at this point). first, pure spearmint tea is pretty hard to find, most of those sold in stores are mixed with some other flavors. prior to using tao of tea, i have been drinking alvita\'s spearmint tea (this is sold at most health food stores), and the flavor really tasted like mint and has a very strong (in a good way) mint aroma to it. however, i wanted to try loose teas as i read that they are usually better (for various reasons which i won\'t get into).<br /><br />well, let\'s just say that there\'s a world\'s difference between the two. not only is this loose tea much stronger than alvita\'s tea bags, but even the taste is different. i actually grew up eating spearmints, and my parents grow them in our backyard (i\'m asian-american), so i know exactly what the actual leaves taste like. i didn\'t taste any of that in alvita\'s (and pukka\'s 3 mint tea). it took me a while to realize that spearmint tea was the same spearmint i\'ve been eating all my life! when i tasted tao of tea\'s, i thought to myself "there\'s that flavor i\'m use to!"<br /><br />so overall, as far as which one is "better" for you, i really don\'t know. however, i can say with certainty that this loose tea definitely tastes like actual spearmint, and not just, well...mint (like the kind you get in candies). ironically, i actually like alvita\'s taste more because it tastes like the commercialized mint we\'re all used to. however, without a doubt, tao of tea (i have not tried other loose tea brands) is more "authentic" tasting, so i\'ll continue using loose teas rather than bags.<br /><br />i mix this spearmint tea with loose green tea that i buy at the asian supermarket (this mix is generally called "moroccan mint" apparently). using alvita\'s, all i tasted was the green tea, but using toft\'s i actually taste the spearmint a lot more....<br /><br />note: this review is mostly a comparison of bagged teas vs. loose teas. i don\'t mean to imply that the alvita brand itself is inferior.', 'got 36 bags at a very good price. only problem is the "best used by date" is less than 6 weeks away.

me a little over $5. next time i'll keep the box.)<br /><br />i have read good things about keurig customer service and their replacing brewers out of warranty due to priming problems, but since i already had this warranty and it wasn't a priming problem, i didn't contact keurig.  they might have been helpful too - i don't know.<br /><br />before i knew square trade would come through so quickly, we went to the store and bought a mr. coffee brewer for $79.00.  our intent is just to use it until the new keurig comes and then put it in our travel trailer for weekend trips (instead of taking the keurig with us).  while the mr. coffee is quieter, it takes much longer to heat the water and we have yet to get rid of an odd after taste from it.  i'm going to run vinegar through it to see if that helps but so far it is rather disappointing.<br /><br />another side note:  i buy my coffee from green mountain.com online.  if you join their club you get a pretty decent discount and they sell 24 pack product, not the 18 that you buy in the store.  if you join the club (automatic shipments) and order 4 or more at a time they pay the shipping. you can set the interval at the number of weeks that is right for you and it's easy to change if your circumstances change.  recently they included free samples (a full 24 cup box) of their hot apple cider.  that wouldn't happen at the grocery store.<br /><br />in summary, i love my keurig.  being without it for a few days has really made me realize how much i love it.  is it more expensive than a pot of brewed coffee - yes.  but to me it is well worth it.  i will buy another square trade warranty though - just to be safe.<br /><br />addendum 5/3/12.  my new unit came today.  i had ordered the classic (b44) because i could get

that was a huge disappointment.  they don't show the cup sizes in either of the write-ups on amazon and it's not easy to find in writing anyplace.  because i can't return it, we're going to put this one in the trailer, return the mr. coffee to the store (still tastes funny after 3 days including a white vinegar cleaning) and get the elite 40 for home use.  live and learn.", "we have purchased this product before from the same seller (aworldofpups) and received a wonderful dog treat that was soft enough to break into multiple treat size pieces. my puppies absolutely loved them. we ordered

eat. we did give them one half of a treat each and were amazed at how long it took them to chew threw this small piece of treat. these are dogs that usually can chew through anything quite quickly. i held off writing a negative review until i heard back from the company. however their policy is that i must pay for the shipping on the return and i can not return anything opened. after numerous emails back and forth they appear to be unconcerned (at least they have not commented on) the fact that this particular bag appears to be defective and unsafe for consumption. the lamination on the bag itself arrived peeling. upon closer inspection the product is made in china so the lack of quality control is not surprising, however the lack of concern and willingness to take responsibility by

that the soil that the tree was planted in was too dense and didn\'t allow for any oxygen to reach the roots.  he seemed to think that the gardenia tree was ok, but not the fukien tea tree.  he didn\'t think that transplanting the tree this soon after receipt would help since these trees need time to adjust to their new surroundings.  also mentioned in the directions that came with both

quality foods.  that said, the price of this single bag from drugstore.com is a bit costly when compared to discount stores. note that this listing on amazon doesn\'t provide three 4 lb. bags like it says, it only provides one bag at this price. if this price were for three 4 lb. bags like it says, it\'s be a steal of a deal. however, don\'t fall for the listing as you only get one (1) bag. you can get this same bag at target for $14.99 (baking goods isle).  it may not be available at all target stores, so you\'ll want to visit or call. i wasn\'t able to find it at target\'s web site, though. if you don\'t have a target close, then purchasing through amazon may be your best bet. definitely worth a purchase if you love pancakes or waffles, though.<br /><br />if you are looking for

i also personally use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00168637y">just whites all natural egg whites</a> to mix in rather than whole eggs when making waffles.  the just whites are great because you can store them on the shelf without worrying about buying eggs or worrying about eggs going bad (or being contaminated).<br /><br />note, i\'m only giving this listing 4 stars, not because of the mix, but because of the faulty listing.  pamela\'s mix is 5 stars all the way.  this is a high quality product and is definitely worth a try.  just be aware of the problems with this listing before you buy.<br /><br />update: it looks like someone has corrected this listing to the correct price for 3 bags.  so, at the ~$60 price tag for this item will probably get you 3 4lb bags of this

coffee's packaging, but the important part first: it tastes good. fog chaser is a little more robust than i like for a morning blend (i tend toward a dunkin donuts style coffee first thing in the am), but is perfect for afternoon or evening. the nonstandard pods fit into my b70 and while there has been occasional sediment, it's not been a problem with the majority of my 36-pod pack; at least, not as bad as (say) grove square. yes, i'd buy these again.<br /><br />now the negatives. as has been stated, the pods aren't plastic cups with embedded filters, sealed by a foil cover, but rather filter pouches with a plastic ring and foil cover. there's no need to punch a drain hole in the plastic cup, since there isn't one. i've heard concerns about the keurig success causing more spent k-cups to be dumped in trash tips and landfills; i'd also guess that the construction makes it a non-trivial recycling task. so a redesign with less plastic would seem like a good thing.<br /><br />however, one of the charms of keurig is that the cup is packed in a relatively inert gas: i've heard nitrogen, which would make sense. oxygen is the enemy of coffee. old coffee goes stale because it oxidizes. keeping air away from coffee keeps it fresh... but the coffee in the san francisco bay coffee company's packaging hasn't this feature. the bags (containing twelve pods each) are heavy-duty plastic with a metal button of unknown purpose, and perhaps those bags are filled with something other than oxygen... but as soon as you take them out, the coffee begins to deteriorate.<br /><br />not that this happens in a matter of seconds, or even days. after all, keeping the lid on a pound can of coffee (i can actually remember when a pound was sixteen ounces, not 13.5) kept the coffee fresh enough, assuming you were a regular drinker. if you use a ziploc bag to store the unused pods from an opened bag, i'm sure that they'll stay fresh enough in the week or two that the bag lasts.<br /><br />my concern, though, is for occasional coffee drinkers, for whom the keurig system is a godsend. for example, i dated a woman who hated coffee, but wanted me to have some when i visited. having fresh coffee in an inert storage container would have been great. these, though, might go bad in between my visits to her house.<br /><br />so in conclusion, go ahead and buy these if you're a frequent coffee drinker who will finish a whole 12-pod bag in less than a month. keep a couple of ziploc bags (sandwich bags hold 6) for storage. companies that go through a whole lot of k-cups ought really to like these, especially since they're about 10% under the cost of most k-cups.", "this shampoo was sent in a lightly padded envelope. inside, it was merely wrapped in a  plastic bag - no additional

the more muted tones of several other companies. but, no longer having those options available, i finally gave the brand serious consideration. the ingredient list is pretty good, primarily chicken meal, lamb, and barley. i\'ll hardly say this is ideal--barley is believed to possibly be an allergen, dry foods\' carbohydrate levels are almost as a rule too high for our specialized carnivore friends, and there is a small faction of people who believe meat meals to be of inferior quality--but at the same time, it stacked up pretty well pound to pound with my old foods, and with a similar ingredient list. it was also notably cheaper, however. i bought it, and my cats were immediately made fans. my male cat is much pickier than his female companion, but he was more than happy to chow down.<br /><br />**i was going to leave the review as stated, but i have found out something that may be troubling to fellow pet owners. solid gold apparently lets its production be handled by

understand why this company chooses to add sugar to a fruit that they claim is tree-ripened.  i am truly baffled.  the added sugar leaves a crystalline sweetness that is not mango-flavored to the fruit and renders it a ridiculous replacement for mango.  it ends up being too sweet.<br /><br />why buy dried mango?  if you cannot get fresh mango, it is the next best thing.  canned mango, because the canning procedure demands heating the food above boiling point, dismantles all enzymes and antioxidants, but the drying process does not.  there are 3 fruits that are particularly valuable for the enzymes found in them: kiwi, pineapple, and mango.  these enzymes are not made by our bodies but are particularly helpful for the fast transport of calcium, boron, magnesium, phosphate, and manganese into cells whose membranes have been damaged (e.g. by circulating toxins, poisons, both of which we are always bombarded with, even if we do not recognize the symptoms).  these ions, and thus the fruit enzymes, are critical for repair of those cells.  since bacterial infections leave poisons behind, good dried mango is especially helpful for fast recovery from infections.<br /><br />the best mango is thoroughly dried, making it quite brittle.  if you want to snack on it or make mango ice cream, you reconstitute it by adding just enough water to cover a few slices (in warm weather it will take about an hour to reconstitute 1/2 cup).  keep some in the refrigerator for just that purpose.  they last in that form there for at least a week, unless you live where there is an enormous amount of wet weather and thus a lot of mold.  prevent mold survival in the refrigerator by keeping there a small plastic container with holes punched in the top half full of vinegar. your fruits and veges will last a lot longer.<br /><br />however the best way to eat it is to add chopped mango to your entree or salad.  thus this stuff this company is selling is just too weak in flavor, but the sugar

sad to say, i found it too sweet. the reason for it's being sweet is that in addition to sugar, it is sweetened with sucralose (aka splenda.) this is a new trend in foods-- a mix of natural and artificial sweeteners. (have you seen chewing gum? even the non-sugar-free varieties have aspartame?) the reason for using a mix of natural and artificial is interesting but i believe in this case, using sucralose lowers the calorie count of the cocoa and it also allows more sweetener in a smaller cup size, as sucralose takes up less space than granulated sugar. i had to tease out the ingredient info by carefully reading the box, as it doesn't say so on the cup.<br /><br />here's the good news, if you don't want sucralose, or even if you don't want sugar and sucralose, you can buy packet cocoas and make a cup

these bones about eight times and all-in-all, i am happy.  i gave it a four-star rating because i typically am very conservative when rating items.  my dog is a large yellow lab, about 100 pounds.  ideally, these bones are a little too small for him, but they are a good deal.  i wish that they were a little bit bigger.  however, if you have a dog of approximately 35-70 pounds, then they might be fine.  my dog does eat them quickly (within ten minutes), but he seems to enjoy them.  there seems to be about 20 per bag, but i will have to check this more closely when i receive my next shipment.<br /><br />i am very aware of what i eat and what my dog eats.  so i was very careful when giving him the first bone.  i gave him one and waited a few days before giving him a second, just to see how he reacted.  everything was fine, and continues to be fine.<br /><br />one thing that i don\'t like, but will probably not bother most people, is that they are packed in a very thick type of plastic bag; very durable, but it scares the heck out of me because i don\'t like plastic touching food, due to potential chemicals that can be released, especially during shipping when they might be subjected to very warm temperatures in planes or trucks.  so i take all of the bones out as soon as i receive them and put them in a big cardboard box that i am able to seal up.<br /><br />in summary, i am happy with these bones because my dog never reacted negatively or got sick and they seem to be of acceptable quality.  one final note, if you order the beef-flavored bones, which are dark brown in color, please note that when my dog starts getting them wet from his mouth, that they heavily stained my light tan carpet.  so i stick with these chicken-flavored, or the peanut-butter

broken) and it\'s not returnable.  in today\'s economy, i\'m trying to make smarter decisions with where i throw my money.  this tea product is a luxury for me.  i, like you, have roamed around stores without luck of finding the product.  i decided i\'d go with plan b which is to search the internet and was thrilled to find it on amazon.  however, plan c is to "move on" and most likely start making "cold brewed iced tea" from tea bags.  good luck if you order this... but maybe it\'s time to "move on."  lipton is thriving on the shelves but nestea tastes better in my opinion! i give the tea 4 stars for taste but one star for packaging.', "i love the smell of the drink mix but the taste is beyond sour. i don't like that much sour in my drink mix.", 'the first disappointment came when i opened the box and discovered the size of the "bars" which were barely bigger than a tootsie roll snack size.  the oatmeal raisin that i tried was much too sweet and consisted mostly of rice.  i saw

50% that were usable, they were very thin, torn in places and had to be patched together sometimes.  i stuffed them with rice, etc. and never overstuff.  i think that they processed the grape leaves in brine solution for too long.  as far as my prep on them, i rinsed them and put them on warm water and gently boiled for 1 minute.  i do this all the time and have never encountered such leaves.  i knew prior to gently boiling them that the leaves were fragile because they broke apart in my hand as i was taking them out.  don\'t buy this brand to stuff.  stick with another brand.  i can\'t

chew to try and she loves this one. most of the pieces are thinner but still last a good day of chewing. i cant even get within 2 feet of her before she starts growling then she just runs away with it lol. i find that most of the chews for the hextra are much thinner and easier to cut with basic scissors. for the enzymatic half the time i have to use a knife to cut it. after she had a taste of the hextra she slowly steers away from the enzymatic each time we give her one. after 2 weeks whenever we give her the enzymatic she just licks it a couple times and then walk away. for the hextra she still goes crazy over them! she goes through all the tricks i taught her without saying the commands lol. i dont know what the big health difference between the hextra and enzymatic but if i had to recommend one i would suggest getting the hextra. hands down your dog will love it. now im stuck with a big bag of cet enzymatic that my dog no longer likes because she prefers the hextra. like anyone

conditions which preclude their consumption as confectionery, they are not considered to be in the category of food or confectionery."<br /><br />because they are not categorized for food or confectionery, the fda does not want the manufacturer to list the ingredients. however, it may be helpful to know that they are made mostly of sugar. they may also contain small amounts of gum arabic, wheat flour, artificial coloring, and/or a very thin coating of silver.<br /><br />the european union recognizes silver as a legitimate color additive and states that "small amounts of it consumed on special occasions are not harmful." silver appears in medicines, cough drops and tooth fillings as well as in our water supply in controlled amounts. it is used to purify city drinking and swimming

of corn, soy, wheat, or gluten of any kind. two of my cats just turned twenty-two, a third will be twenty-two in a month, and a fourth is ten years of age, so i include canned food in their diet twice

been maxwell house coffee\'s \'signature line\' for a very long time.  and, in the case of their regular instant coffee, it holds wonderfully true, even today!  (probably for all the rest of their coffees, as well!!!!)<br /><br />i truly feel for the author of the previous review.  maxwell house has changed the jar top (at least on the 8-ounce size).  it is now yellow, and the top has "easy-to-open" printed in blue letterings.  i don\'t know if they have done the same with the two-ounce size jar-top or not.  but i do know -- after many years of drinking maxwell house instant coffee....first with a red metal screw-on top (with a lovely 5-pointed white star printed on it), and then to the familiar red plastic screw-on top, (no star printed on it) -- that, despite the jar being somewhat easier to open, (it has been approved by the american arthritis foundation), that i sorely miss the beautiful red screw-on lids that i grew up with.  (in fact, i kept the last one i was able to find....but, being plastic, it cracked and broke.  so, now i must use the new, easier-to-open, yet somehow not-as-inviting yellow-with-blue-lettering jar top, if i want to buy and use maxwell house instant coffee.)<br /><br />if the new, blue top, is on the 2 oz size as well, i hope that my mention of it can help both you, and your grandmother, to find maxwell house instant, if you wish to!<br /><br />the good news is that the coffee inside is the same as ever!  it is not the most "gourmet" of coffees.....but it does have a very nice flavour, if made correctly.  (to make good instant coffee....of any brand....the number one rule is: boil the water a lot!  you simply cannot over-boil water that you will later pour over instant coffee!  the longer you boil the water, the better-tasting instant coffee will be.  one trick i learnt<br />to make the water boil longer...yet save on gas and electricity...is this:<br />use a 2 or 3 quart saucepan to boil the water, not a tea-kettle.  then, first, put in just enough water to cover the bottom...plus an extra ounce or two. put the heat on high, and wait until the water starts to boil.<br />(with a glass pan, you can cover the pan and make it boil even faster, thus saving even more gas or electricity.)  when the water just starts to begin to boil, put in a bit more water.  when that water just starts to begin to boil, add more.  and so on...until you fill the pot with the right amount of water.  you have to be careful -- especially at the beginning -- not to let all the water boil out, or your pot will be ruined!  but if done correctly, this not only saves power, (as the smaller amounts of water, naturally, take less power to boil), but also boils the water far more than if you just put all the water in at once!<br />so, you get a better tasting cup of instant coffee....and also help preserve the planet, at the same time !  : )  (this method of boiling water is not recommended for tea, however.  tea needs water that has been boiled, yes...but boiled as little as possible. indeed, i have read, (in "the little princesses", by marion crawford, which i have also reviewed for amazon.com -- that queen mary, herself, used to wait until the water for her tea had just started to boil, before using it for tea.<br />(i guess this boiling water less for tea, can help save natural resources, too!)<br /><br />the main thing i want to say, of course, is that maxwell house instant coffee has a wonderful flavour, especially if you make it with really boiled water!  it is the least-expensive of brand name instant coffees...and gives a nice, invitingly-flavoured cup of coffee!  if you like, you can always mix it with other, more expensive instant, (or even regular) coffees....but it\'s great all by itself.<br /><br />if you want a great tasting cup of instant coffee, yet want to save money, and yet still again, not buy a "store brand" instant coffee, then maxwell house instant coffee is for you!  it is, and always has been,<br />"good to the last drop!"<br /><br />p.s.:  i still yearn, however, to taste maxwell house\'s more varied regular ground coffees in instant form.  please, maxwell house...treat your instant-coffee customers to "1897" coffee, and the other types of maxwell house ground coffee, in instant form.  i predict they will all be an "instant hit" with

the driving forces in consumer products.  this product and its cousins are no exception.<br /><br />first off, the product tastes just like spenda to me in my iced tea.  it is good to know that i might be getting some nutrition with my sweetener, then i looked at the economics of it.  nutritionally enhanced spenda costs ($0.09/packet) about three times more than regular splenda ($0.03/packet).  now that may not seem like much but if you put two packets in your coffee that is 12 cents a cup.  many of us have multiple drinks in a day, adding to your routine. no so much to make you think twice as you get 'more' with spenda essentials, but it adds up and you may want to think again.<br /><br />i am a little concerned that the addition of the antioxidants requires putting the spenda in a foil packet rather than the simple paper cover for regular spenda.  the packaging kept reminding me that i was getting chemistry along with my sweetener.<br /><br />i am not saying that you should avoid this product and its better getting some vitamins rather than none.  but it seems to me that a more effective approach would be to use regular spenda and take a multivitamin.  not only is it less expensive, but the vitamin provides a broader range of nutrients than what is found in this product.<br /><br />so as a product, its great, tastes like regular spenda, delivers antioxidants and mixes well in my drinks.  economically, i think that you have a better alternative that is cheaper, better nutritionally and still gives you all of spenda's taste.", "i haven't had a lot of experience with

neither a vet nor a dentist). the only reason i have not bought these for other years has had to do with my proximity to a petsmart, where i used to buy them. tonight, i came to amazon to order some for her upcoming birthday, and i read what i think may be misleading reviews. to help people with their purchases, let me add a little bit here.<br /><br />first, a description. these look, feel and sound a lot like pieces of strofoam packing peanuts, only about 3/4 the size. they are wide in circumference, maybe a half inch or a bit more. they are difficult to get into a mouth of a cat, ie. the reviewer's persian, true. the way they work is to have the cat work the fishy styrofoam through the teeth several times in order to scrape off plaque and tartar. although my old girl is only 6 lbs, i also have had a 20 lb calico and an 11 lb persian. all three cats did well with these treats. they seemed to chew them for a while, and the squeaking sound on their teeth as they ate made me feel like they did their job.<br /><br />second, cost. these are definitely more expensive than several kinds of cat treats. i would not give them as treats, frankly, but more as a tooth brushing.<br /><br />third, i cannot verify if they are effective or not empirically. i know that the vet is routinely surprised by my 16-yr. old cat's teeth. 1. she still has them all. 2. they look great with very

aloe and the slightly tart passion fruit. the drink is sweet--not overly sweet, but i wish it was a little less sweet for my tastes. the biggest surprise was the mouth-feel or body of the drink, which has a viscous quality, reminiscent of very thin jelly. there\'s a good amount of pulp and little clumpiness to it that could turn some people off. i like it. it\'s very refreshing and perfect on a hot

with low expectations i opted to give it a fair chance before reading a single review.<br /><br />i mistakenly applied this product single-agent to a sandwich. i have not yet managed to consume this in its entirety; it was a failed experiment. i will hold off on throwing this out until i have mustered up the courage to attempt it in a different setting. it has a few positive reviews, so i suspect that it may be redeemable somehow (i may take up some reviewers\' suggestions) but thus far i believe this product to be a travesty; this is coming from a person who can tolerate certain well-known brands of veggie bacon.<br /><br />okay, i knew this product would be so different from actual pb that it would be unfair to compare it. i did not expect it to resemble pb, however i did expect it to resemble food at least in some remote fashion. the texture is that of a synthetic, waxy, fluffy butter (why is it "whipped"???). the taste is.. somewhat akin to the same, but i would not recommend it as a butter substitute except in non-food usages which i may attempt, as i hate to be wasteful. i would compare the taste to what i would expect of a spread made from crayons. brown crayons, ew.<br /><br />so here\'s my 100% honest and dead-serious evaluation: truly, you and i are better off looking to natural sources with awesome flavor and more balanced nutrition to go with the calories. we could probably do with a little less artifice all around, and this product has no nutritional value whatsoever-- except some sodium. it even lacks dietary fiber, despite vegetable fiber being the second ingredient listed (after water)! if you are trying to eat healthier, this is surely not the way. if you are on a low-calorie diet, learn portion control-- and i empathize with the pain you feel in even considering cutting down on our beloved peanut butter. as for myself, i have to get my protein from somewhere and pb is my main squeeze, so in my pantry the walden farms was never destined to be more than a novelty to begin with.<br /><br />the one good thing that came of this experience, besides satisfying my curiosity? a number of the 1-star reviews praised certain other walden farms products despite this unforgettable failure. i consider this a brave endorsement as i would personally be embarrassed to defend the entities that brought this abomination into our world. so brave, in fact, that i am convinced of their authenticity (unless all of these individuals are trolling), and will be looking forward to sampling other walden farms products (this was my first). but, as for redeeming this one, i am not hopeful.<br /><br />bottom line:<br /><br />- i do not recommend this product in any way.<br /><br />- i cannot recommend any alternative low-cal pb substitutes as i have not personally sampled any others.<br /><br />+ i do recommend maranatha for a more natural and flavorful nut butter experience. with some self-control it is worth the calories and the price.<br /><br />+ i highly recommend, in addition to the above, diet and exercise. if you can\'t cut portions, walk it off.', 'i purchased these because i wanted to have some smaller marshmallows - not miniature, but somewhere in between.  these are the perfect size for children!', 'even the dog wouldn\'t eat this. seriously. i wanted something healthy, free of corn syrup, msg, soy this-and-that, and all those multisyllabic mystery ingredients that only the fda could love. this cereal gains a star for that. the ingredients are "wheat bran, whole grain corn flour, whole grain wheat flour, corn bran, cinnamon". (the nutrition panel does mention that the cereal is produced in a facility that also handles soy, dairy, and tree nuts.) but there\'s got to be something natural that can be added to pick up the flavor a bit. as it is, it tastes like pressed sawdust. any cinnamon included is so subtle as to not be noticeable. nature gives us fiber in flavorful packages - vegetables and fruits. if fiber is the main goal, there are tastier ways to get it.<br /><br />the texture is pretty much pressed sawdust too. there\'s got to be a way to at least make it texturally interesting. the drab color is fine, that means the product has no artificial food dyes. i don\'t care so much about visual appeal but it is a little disconcerting opening a box and seeing contents that are formed like snail pellets.<br /><br />with a name like "simply fiber" the appeal is going to be for old folks seeking the grail of an expeditious digestive system. the absence of typical ingredients may also appeal to those who find themselves allergic to many processed foods. my interest was more in just the general "healthy" appeal.<br /><br />to give the manufacturer their due, it\'s probable that some of nature\'s flavoring agents might not last long on the shelf. next thing you know there\'s the temptation to dump in a bunch of preservatives, and that\'s not necessarily a good trade-off. you know how breakfast cereals typically liven up the front of the box by populating the cereal bowl with colorful fruits or berries? in this case i think it\'s not just decorative, it\'s a good idea. reasonably expect the cereal to be a little dull, and compensate by slicing in some strawberries, blueberries or bananas.<br /><br />on the bright side, this is only 100 calories to a 3/4 cup serving, according to the side panel. that serving packs 14g of fiber. at first bite i was tempted to toss the box but i\'ll probably keep it on hand and toss a baggie of this stuff in with my lunch for that hand-to-mouth grazing a person does for a mid-morning snack. that\'s certainly less fattening than what passes for granola.<br /><br />in sum, the product isn\'t calorie-heavy and it will appeal to aging boomers with digestive issues. it may also be a product of choice for those with certain allergies.', 'these lollipops are not as pictured. they came in assorted colors, some really drab, not the rainbow brights

heavy stuff would cost a lot to ship but with prime it did not.  i'm finding most of my dry goods on here and it is well worth it!", "few things i'd like to point out:<p>1.  &quot;espresso&quot; is not a roast.  it's a drink.  in northern italy they make espresso from vienna roast, in southern italy they use french.  starbucks appears to be using french roast, so they should just label it french roast like any normal person would.<p>2.  the product description says &quot;taste espresso roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. this is one versatile coffee!&quot;  this is patently absurd.  it's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  here's why:<p>making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  if you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  if you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  you get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.<p>therefore, a &quot;universal grind&quot; is an impossibility.  they should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.<p>3.  it's over-roasted.  starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  then they roast all their beans vienna or french.  most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not vienna or french.  so why roast all your beans too dark?  i guess it's just easier that way.  also, it lets them rename vienna roast as &quot;starbucks roast&quot; because the austrians don't seem to care.<p>that said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.<p>anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:<p>buy a grinder.  nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  if you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  if you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  it's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for starbucks you should invest in one.<p>find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  freshness matters!  good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.<p>ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  most people don't use the right amount.  if you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.", "i ordered this officepro with the office in mind.  when i received it, i unboxed it at my house and set it up.  this is the loudest coffee machine i have ever heard.  it produces a loud

heat press to  melt the plastic and a plastic sticker folded over the top which did little to keep the tea from spilling out. accordingly, the tea had a strong plastic odor and had lost any semblance of its essential tea oils. to be fair, this was likely a high quality gyokuro in another life(a yame perhaps?) unfortunatley, i\'ll never know as the pathetic packaging ruined its flavor. i\'ve tossed it in the dust bin and relegated it to experience.

hexagonal.  the drink is more of a passion fruit drink, and less like a tea drink.  in hawaii, the shelves of grocery stores sell juice that contains passion fruit juice, called pog.  pog contains passion fruit juice, orange juice, and guava juice.  passion fruit, known in hawaii as lilikoi, are a beautiful yellow/orange on the outside, but a bland gray on the inside.  when consumed, the lilikoi has little pulpy thingees.  the chantea aloe vera green tea also has the same little pulpy thingees, which makes it a truly unique drink.  at any rate, if you don\'t mind the little pulpy, squiggley thingees that are in home-made squeezed orange juice, then you will not mind the little pulpy thingees in chantea aloe vera green tea.  this product is fine for packing into routine lunches.

right next to the earth.<br /><br />if the tunnel is a few inches down, dig a small section of the tunnel out (like 6 inches), place the trap inside, and fill it with loose soil.  the moles with try to make their way through the tunnel but will inevitably push up slightly on the trigger, causing their most unfortunate death.  occassionally they will still be alive so be prepared for angry moles!

deserves ***** 5 stars but the seller zero for misrepresentation. ys farms raw honey is a very good raw honey, very good tasting and i have consumed many jars of the ys farm raw honey but this is not an organic raw honey, it is conventional regardless how good it tastes. it is good enough that i just ordered few jars of this from vitamin shoppe since they were selling it for $5.91 a jar. i consume the organic one as well. the labeling on the jar is specified as y.s. eco bee farms. there is no misrepresentation by the ys, it is by the sellers including amazon where they specify as organic just to boost their sells but then after busted they close that chapter or correct the disclaimer. apparently monsanto recently contributed $4.2 million to defeat the ballot measure scheduled for california voters on november 6, 2012, proposition 37, along with dupont, bayer, basf, syngenta, and other biotech companies that have each contributed over a million dollars each in their attempt to keep us the consumer in the dark about gmos in our food. ys farms sells 100% organic honey with certification and usda stamp for more money. consumers like lizabeth have chosen to make misleading comments. for lizabeth to discredit usda, organic certification process, as well as ys farms when ys farms sells the organic honey, and then define a non organic honey as "some of the best organic raw honey out there" is appalling. hopefully consumers will get the chance to read the facts and educate themselves accordingly and organic farmers will keep producing organic produce for individuals who actually want organic instead of conventional, regardless of lizabeth\'s misleading comments and explanations.<br /><br />some of the best organic raw honey out there!, april 22, 2012<br />by lizabeth (bartlesville, ok, united states)<br />our very favorite raw honey comes from all about bees in ralston, ne but this honey is a very, very close second. i resorted to bringing in honey from afar when i no longer had access to our favorite. i wanted to buy honey locally and everybody says theirs is "raw" but it isn\'t unless it is cloudy and a bit gritty like this one is (those are good qualities, i promise!). my kids quickly came to enjoy this texture and taste as their favorite. the clear stuff is too cloyingly sweet. anyway, i will be using this as the honey for my family and the 3 pound size here on amazon with prime is a great deal when they can keep it in stock!<br /><br />sep 4, 2012 6:09:55 pm pdt lizabeth says:<br />i appreciate you notifying me of your concerns. however, until they can put a leash on bees, i don\'t trust any organic labeling for honey! my review is based on reputation, taste, and comparison to my favorite raw honey in addition to many, many years of raw honey consumption. organically certified honey from canada from purportedly pesticide free regions tastes exactly the same to me - i have purchased them both and based my recommendation on my personal opinion and rated it accordingly.<br /><br />this is not some of the best raw honey out there since it is a conventional honey not an organic honey, but it is certainly one of the best conventional raw honey out there. shame on consumers and sellers who misrepresent and misguide public for their own selfish and financial gain.<br /><br />i consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. i consume after any meal since it helps digestion. i used to consume chocolate years ago but i do not anymore since i consume pure cocoa in my power drinks. i am into many sports and quality honey is the best low calorie energy i can get to boost my immune system and give me healthy energy when i am middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. i drink lots of tea and i never use honey instead i use molasses. molasses does not lose its nutrition when heated but any further heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollens in honey so i only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon. this is a superfood to me only when it is from quality producers, in a raw stage, and not mixing it with hot drinks in moderation. honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. after a day when my wounds are sealed i place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin. bravo.', 'the tea was very weak and not that good. now i have six boxes of tea i that no one in my family likes.', 'i was excited to find a cinnamon gum

twice a day and applying<br />lots of products. if you wouldn't eat it don't apply it to your skin, your body absorbs all those chemicals.<br /> i believe that cutting way back on coffee, and

with, it\'s true, but it tastes like rubber, smells bad when it\'s cooking, and has no flavor until you add your own spices.  i have no idea why i used to cook with this stuff so often other than that i didn\'t know much about cooking in hs and it looked "high protein" on the label.  i recently read the whole soy story by kaayla daniel (amazon has it), and was amazed to learn that processed soy products like tsp are processed at high temperatures, denaturing the proteins and leaving in loads with antinutrients that damage the thyroid among many other health problems they cause.  although tsp appears to be almost all protein (like meat or tofu), in reality, you don\'t absorb much of the protein, anyway.  while i am glad bob\'s is using organic soybeans to make their tsp (thereby leaving out the pesticides and genetically engineered ingredients), the fact that it\'s "organic" doesn\'t make it a healthy or even a safe product.  the dangerous antinutrients in soy are not a chemical additive or pesticide, they are in intrinsic part of the beans themselves, the plant\'s natural way of deterring pests.  traditional foods made from soy and eaten over the past 400+ years were slow cooked and fermented, destroying the antinutrients and leaving the protein, vitamins, and minerals intact.  tsp is the total opposite of whole, healthy, fermented soy products like tempeh or miso soup, as it is not fermented and leaves in all the antinutrients.  as a longtime vegan on a gluten-free diet because of food allergies, i\'ll continue to buy other bob\'s products (they have an amazing gluten-free line), but i am saddened they are still making highly-processed, extremely unhealthy items like tsp.', 'lapsang souchong tea leaves are smoked over an oak fire.  as a result the

kefir grains, but the product was shipped in a plastic tub that had nothing, like tape, to keep it closed during shipment. as a result the product arrived in a plastic lined shipping envelope, but the plastic container had come open and what (if any) liquid was shipped with the product had spilled out along with the grains, inside the envelope, with only a few grains remaining in the plastic tub. simply adding some cellophane tape or shipping tape around the edges of the plastic tub lid/container would likely have kept the product contained properly during shipping. also the package was hot when it arrived. the grains "looked" large and healthy, if a little bit crushed, however i have tried making milk kefir 2-3 times since i received the product, according to the instructions included in the shipment, and the milk curdles very little, even if i leave the grains for two days, instead of just one. i\'m hoping the grains are still just in shock. some grains seem to float while others sink to the bottom of the glass jar filled with fresh whole milk, that i cover using a rubber band and coffee filter, so the mixture can breath at room temperature away from any direct light. also the grains were in large clumps in the shipment or appeared to be, but now have broken down to much smaller clumps. the color of the grains is close to the color of milk. i\'m hoping the grains that sink to the bottom aren\'t dead or totally inactive, but most milk kefir makers seem to indicate their grains float on the surface or the milk. i\'ll try making milk kefir for one more week, but if the milk still isn\'t curdling, then i\'m afraid these grains arrived dead/inactive and likely never will become active. any buyers should be forewarned that the seller wants you to pay return shipping for a full refund and says they will not reimburse you for this cost, and this must happen within one week of receiving the product. i purchased water kefir grains from another seller that were shipped with liquid in a totally sealed plastic bag, that arrived unbroken - they have been making water kefir successfully in the same environment, so i\'m certain that the environmental conditions are not a problem, also those water kefir grains have since doubled in volume (grown). i am not using metal utensils, only plastic, nylon, or glass (jars, strainers).<br /><br />it\'s now september

ingredients:<br />ingredients: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates). natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).<br /><br />i took a few sips without looking at the label. the bouquet--if one may sue that term for a drink costing less than $1.00-- was nicely black cherry, but the taste seemed "off."  however, the brain is a wondrous thing: after reading the list of multiple fruit concentrates on the can, my taste expectations changed and i enjoyed the drink more.  there\'s nice carbonation bite in the aftertaste, and it\'s light and refreshing--perhaps due in part to the absence of corn syrup. i may have detected a slightly metallic taste but that may have been psychology too as i was holding a metal can.  ideally, this would come in a bottle, but perhaps that would drive up the price.<br /><br />the nutritional quality seems, once again, more impressive for what you\'re not

it\'s apparently high in sugar content), 100% of vitamin c due in part to adding ascorbic acid (vitamin c). there are no other measurable vitamins listed, no fiber (not a surprise) and no protein (not a surprise either).<br /><br />price<br />let\'s compare this to another quality (i.e., slightly more expensive cherry drink, dr. brown\'s cherry soda. a 24 pack of 12 ounce cans (288 total ounces) costs 24.99, compared to the switch\'s regular price of $24 for 24 cans at 8.3 ounce per can (199.2 total ounces). that comes out to 8.67 cents per can for the doc, and 12.04 cents per can for the switch. dr. brown\'s has an incredible cherry flavor (and it does come in bottles, but at 15.75 cents per ounce) but you\'re getting high fructose corn syrup, caramel coloring, sodium benzoate as a preservative, and red 40 for additional coloring.<br /><br />i think the price is reasonable given all of the so-called "vitamin waters" (here\'s a novel idea, take a vitamin with some water from the tap), and for those who practically need a little carbonation to feel refreshed, this is an excellent product. for pure cherry taste, however, i\'d probably go with boylan\'s or dr. brown\'s high quality, but more traditionally soda-like drinks.  bottom line, switch is worth trying, but if you\'re buying through amazon, make sure you spend $25 or more so that you don\'t pay shipping!', 'a

"meal" after the meat, it means the meat weight was measured before the meat was dehydrated.  if it says "meal" after the meat, the weight was measured after the meat was dehydrated.  therefore, "meals" constitute more meat in the product composition than meats listed without meal after them.<br /><br />from the ingredients list on amazon for this product, i expected the meats included were

carcinogenic preservative. it accumulates in the liver and causes damage down the road. unless you can get written verification that this company buys fish meal that does not contain ethoxyquine, do not feed this food. i think it states on the bag that no artificial preservatives are "added". this just means that solid gold company did not add artificial preservatives in their formulation (dog food companies are not required to list ingredients which were already present in the meals that they purchased). fish meal in dry dog food is the newest fad since it is now recognized that dogs need essential omega 3 fatty acids. unfortunately, these fatty acids have a very short shelf life (a week maybe?)and so dry dog food is not a reliable supply for these fats. adding large amounts of a very strong anti-oxidant (ethoxyquine, which was developed as a pesticide and later found to be excellent for preventing the oxidation of latex rubber)is the only way to keep fish dregs (i.e. "fish meal")from becoming overly putrid. if you don\'t have a good preservative, then your dog ends up eating rancid fats which are also toxic. solution: feed a natural diet of real food. if you still want to feed kibble, buy one that does not contain ethoxyquine and fish meal, then supplement your dog with human grade fish oil capsules. also, don\'t fall for the flaxseed gimmick either. the short chain omega 3 fatty acids in flaxseed are not converted to the essential long chain fatty acids that high food chain mammals need. dogs do not have the enzyme to make the conversion (ruminants do and so do krill!)', "i drink this stuff all the time. it is a loose tea so if the particles bother you you may like a tea ball. i drink mine from a hallowed out gourd with a silver straw.<br /> it can have a

block them or in their throat and choke them.  i threw them away after reading that and reading sad stories of others who had to take their dog to the vet, expensive surgeries and such.  i\'ll never buy them or anything like them again.  i don\'t get anything for her that is rawhide, can splinter, etc.  the best thing i\'ve found for her to chew on that is edible and safe is called "beefeaters

however, about two weeks later, the blade on the machine started to rust. i hand wash my machine 90% of the time with organic soap - this was alarming and made me question the quality. shortly after that, the blade began getting stuck in the machine. there are instructions in the manual that tell you what to do if this happens. it worked but i had to do it every time i used the machine. i was constantly splattering food everywhere. next, i had the black oil leaking from the drive shaft. i removed the drive shaft with every wash and never put it in the dishwasher. i cleaned it up and hoped it wouldn't happen again. following this, the blade became completely lodged in the machine and unremovable. i did receive a quick call back from customer service and when they asked for the lot number, i lifted up the machine to realize the entire bottom had melted. the plastic was all disformed. the last batch of applesauce i made had the black oil in it. the company offered me a new machine but i am refusing. i do not want anything from this maker. i see that it has happened to other parents and it is absolutely inexcusable that a foreign black substance is being leeched into our baby's foods!!! this is the whole point of making homemade food - so that you know everything in it. i nearly cried when i discovered the black substance. yes, it's easy and yes it's a great idea. but please, please just steam your baby's food and process it with something reliable and without a strange substance in it!<br /><br />*just to add: contrary to other reviews, i had an excellent experience with baby brezza's customer service. i spoke with two different women who were helpful and seemed truly interested in solving the problem. i may have gotten a rare defect in my machine and i don't want to bash the brand but am very concerned with my experience. i believe that the company will do something about the problems that their customers are experiencing and i hope for future parents that they're able to have a successful machine.<br /><br />*also: i've used a beaba and found that the brezza was a much better machine in terms of proper steaming of food. my experience with the beaba was that the food almost always came out undercooked when steamed according to the times in the manual. i don't recommend that machine either. additionally, i've used a magic bullet for a few years and have never had a perfect blend. i always have to take the cover off and move the food around in order for it all to blend. i am not sure that any of these baby gadgets work but will say that if i didn't have the defective brezza, it would be far superior to a beaba or baby bullet.", 'these "certified organic" (by oregon tilth) baked dog treats are made as a pair of attached treats, 1" x 1.25", separated by a "break" line along the longer dimension.  i put "break" in quotes because, these treats are quite hard & do not always break right on the line.  the ingredients list is "organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin e), organic molasses".  the "guaranteed analysis" is crude protein:  9.0% min, crude fat:  4.0% min, crude fiber:  4.0% max, moisture:  11% max".  fyi, despite being "certified organic", there is a "not intended for human consumption" disclaimer under the ingredients list.  hence, i can personally testify to their delectability (or lack thereof)...  ;o)<br /><br />however, my "test panel" certainly can - if they could talk, that is.  testing these treats were our four rescued shelter dogs:  jolene, a female pit bull & boxer mix, niki, a female boxer mix, cosmo, a male boxer mix, & mollie, a female black lab mix.  in the interest of full disclosure, the first three dogs listed are all eager & voracious eaters - rarely, if ever, do they turn up their noses at a treat.  mollie, on the other hand, is far pickier, being a tentative eater.<br /><br />once placed in a "sit", all four test subjects eagerly anticipated their treat.  for the test, i gave each of them a single 1" x 1.25" treat, having broken them apart in another room.  i gave each subject a treat, one at a time.  jolene, niki & cosmo took their treat without hesitation (cosmo rudely almost taking half of my fingers with his), while mollie had to give it a short "sniff" (as is her custom) prior to gingerly taking it from my hand.  however, once in their possession, all four dogs eagerly devoured their treat, crunching it up in short order, mollie included.  none of the them had any trouble crunching into the treats, from jolene who is only 40 pounds, to cosmo who is 55 pounds.  once finished, they all looked back up with hopeful anticipation in case i had another one to offer them.<br /><br />so, based on these tests, i\'d say these treats were a resounding success.  if i had to take anything away from their score, it would be to dock them ½ star because they are so hard to break apart.  of course, if you have relatively big dogs, you could always just give them two attached treats at a time & forego this issue altogether.  therefore, i still awarded them 5 stars...', 'no more bug problems with this in the house.  inconspicuous, no odor, no worry about pets getting sick.  also like their electric flea trap.', 'my stepdad

list. it\'s not raw and it\'s not as good as raw.<br /><br />secondly, and perhaps just as important, is that the consumer is paying for things their pet can\'t digest. the consumer pays for the very expensive dehydration process for vegetables and other things that carnivores cannot digest and do not need. the only way to get the nutrients out of vegetables, fruits and seeds, and into a dog\'s system is to puree the vegetables and break down the cellulose or to cook them. from i can tell, neither of these things are done to the vegetables. ironically, the part of the thk diet that shouldn\'t be raw is, and the meat, which should be raw, isn\'t.<br /><br />the fact that a great deal of the honest kitchen diets are not digested is pretty obvious to people who feed it to their dogs. you can clearly see the celery, bananas, and other whole chunks of vegetable/fruit that come out in the stool. if you happen to take a look at the stool after a bit of rain has washed away the smooshy parts, you will see mounds of undigested vegetable matter that seem to equal 80% of the total volume. so not only are you feeding something that isn\'t being digested, but you are feeding lots of it. why would you pay for something that is completely wasted?<br /><br />i know several dogs who are or were on thk who presented with hot spots, fleas, allergies, and other chronic conditions

some promise in the ziwi peak line and stella and chewy\'s, so you might want to try those out and stop paying for chunky veggies your dog can\'t digest.<br /><br />it is far less expensive to feed a raw diet of human grade meats and bone from your grocery store. you would probably pay 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of thk diets. you would even save money if you went with a pre-packaged frozen raw diet such

already and even the efficacy of a multivitamin is questioned by the fda.  the reason being that different minerals are absorbed by the body differently, and often require fat in your diet (usually at the time of consumption) to be absorbed along with the vitamin. in other words, just sucking down a vitamin with water isn\'t going to do you much good.  and, in case it\'s not clear that this review is going down the toilet, dumping thousands of milligrams of certain vitamins into your system is going to pass right through you.<br /><br />don\'t tell eboost that.  eboost has 1,000 mg of vitamin c, which is 1,667% the daily recommended value.  let me repeat: one thousand six hundred and sixty seven percent of the daily recommended value.  and here i thought i was okay drinking a glass of orange juice in the morning! i drank a full eight ounces of water with eboost and i\'m surprised my head hasn\'t exploded already.<br /><br />in fact, the only vitamin that eboost doesn\'t include insanely high amounts of is potassium at just 14% of the daily recommended value, because that would reduce the efficacy of the 2,500 mcg of vitamin b12.  do you know how much of the recommended b12 daily value that is?  41,667%.  i read the label twice: forty one thousand six hundred and sixty seven percent of the daily recommended value.<br /><br />a quick search of several health sites

the quality of craftsman-ship that went into making the root beer.  the root beer is creamy and velvetly smoothe.  it just slides down your throat.  the amazing thing is that you then notice that it is definitley the signature boylan\'s cane sugar root beer flavor.  the flavor is deep and complex but mild.  i know this sounds contradictory but you\'ll understand when you taste it for yourself.  then something terrible happened.  i was going into the store to get my weekly bottle only to find that the store had discontinued the root beer.  i was so upset i seriously almost cried.  but then i

listed here on amazon.com in the "ingredients" section. i phoned the company last spring when i first noticed this "adulteration" because i couldn\'t imagine why anyone would add soy lecithin to tea! i\'ve nothing against soy lecithin. sometimes i add it to yoghurt, but that\'s my own choice. also, the source should be organic (or from a reliable supplier like lewis labs), since non-organic soy is almost always genetically modified.<br /><br />anyway, i phoned the company\'s customer relations department and asked what was going on with the soy lecithin. the woman had no idea what i was talking about so i explained, step by step, what i had found on a zinger tea box i had nearly purchased that day. she said she had heard nothing about it but she checked her computer for company updates. after scrolling through many items, she came to a small notice in, as i recall, their in-house march 2008 entry (a year prior to my call), which stated that soy lecithin would now be added to selected teas; no reason was given. that struck me as very odd -- that even their own employees had not been properly notified. the woman apologized for the mix-up. that wasn\'t very satisfactory from my point of view but i let it go. that\'s all the info she had and it certainly wasn\'t her fault that her company obviously wanted to fly under the radar on this one.<br /><br />since then, any time i\'m attracted to a new celestial seasonings product, i first read the ingredients. they used to be a company i trusted -- not anymore -- although i still love their (as-yet) soy-free bengal spice; india spice chai; nutcracker sweet holiday tea; sleepytime; echinacea complete care; vanilla/strawberry/rose ceylon black tea; moroccan pomegranate; and red safari spice.  but i now carefully check those labels too whenever i buy a new batch lest celestial seasonings have pulled a fast-one and added soy lecithin to them as well!<br /><br />why haven\'t customers raised more of a hullabaloo over this? probably because this company has indeed had our trust for many years (never mind that they\'ve been sold to less trustworthy firms along the way!) and no one bothers to read their labels! maybe now

heat it as slightly as possible - i.e., i don\'t leave it sitting on the flame - to melt it so that it blends well into the smoothies and gives the smoothies a very nice, thick consistency.  in the warmer months this is no issue as the oil stays liquid and i use it straight from the container.  i am not a big fan of cooking with coconut oil, as i don\'t seem to be able to get it to prevent foods

well.<br /><br />the nutiva organic coconut oil has a very light, clean and fresh taste.  though i cannot ever detect the slight coconut flavor in the smoothies i make, i do sometimes taste it in

making iced coffee.  that's a definite plus.  it is not as satisfying at room temperature.<br /><br />the flavor, apart from being strong, is harsh to the taste and does not provide the satisfaction that a starbucks or other espresso drinks in a can/bottle do.  as a pick-me-up, the drink is appropriate, since its hefty dose of caffeine will give the drinker an infusion of energy.  compared to other similar drinks on the market, sugar content is low (which accounts for its bitterness).<br /><br />for those averse to caffeine or those who have trouble sleeping if they drink too much brewed

must admit, it has very little flavor.  it's almost like drinking water with a slight mushroom taste.  truthfully, i miss the salt.  i think that soup, generally, needs salt but as i stated, most are much too salty, however, this soup is just too bland.  when i added a little bit of salt, that made a big difference.  also, i noticed that the soup is very watery and thin.  i like my mushroom soup a little more substantial.  i do think this soup would work very well in casserole recipes.  i probably will not purhase the low sodium variety of campbell's mushroom soup but i do like many of their other products.  however, and this is important, if it is an absolute necessity that you cut back on salt for health reason, then this soup would be perfect for you. some non-salt seasoning could make it more flavorful.  i give campbell's credit for trying to make their products more health conscious.  more companies should do the same.  salt and sugar must and should be reduced -- a little can go

back to cytomax; it\'s the only one that seems to do the job (for me).  the one disagreement i have with the other reviewers, and this is a matter of personal preferences, is that it does not "taste great".  not even close to great.  orange?  really?  whatever.  tangy?  pffft.  to me, it tastes like a flat diet soda. if that sounds appealing to you, dive in.  i mix it with green tea instead of

do that, it doesnt taste strong, it tastes wrong. i actually got sick to my stomach from drinking this stuff, and never drank it after that. even watering down what i made too strong, couldnt make a drink that i could stomach. however, i did wonder why it made me sick, and looked up what the manufactorers stuck in this bottle. the main ingrediant is maltic acid (c4-h8-o7), which is an organic chemical that occurs in fruit (apples). next up is propylene glycol (c3-h8-o2), which is anti-freeze. i know its used in some flavorings, but probibly not at this strenght. next up, is citric acid

a situation, where you are required to drink tap water that has worst tasting chemicals in it, than you have in this mio liquid. in that case, it might even improve the flavor of bad tap water. however, if you can avoid it, stay away from putting organic chemicals into your body that are better used for industrial purposes, or car engines. in fact, buy a squeeze lemon, and some artificial sweetener, and make your own flavor called lemonaid. or, drink pure, clean, filtered water. i can only relate my experience. if mixed weak, tastes like watered down coolaid. if mixed strong, turns

more like fresh cows milk than the manufactured stuff you buy in the mega-mart. now you might find that taste offensive, but compared to evaporated milk or even store bought, it isn\'t all that bad.

the quarts. i found that it weighs light, meaning a slight half cup really is more suitable for about 750 ml, which is the stainless steel water bottle i mix it in. i add a little water to the bottle, pour in the dry milk, add some more water and shake it up really well, let it rest and shake it again. after each shaking it gets pretty foamy, so once the foam then dissipates i top off the bottle

eaten many "health" bars, fiber bars, protein bars, etc.  i usually eat a protein bar a day, and i am very used to the chalky texture and taste of protein bars and have learned to overcome them.  the pure natural chocolate almond bar is not a protein bar, but tastes almost as bad as that. correction, it tastes, worse than a protein bar.  there is no real chocolate taste to it at all, and the protein chunks that are in it taste like these cheap almond pieces they used to shove into candy bars 30 years ago, way too small to offer any real taste.  actually, they taste just like the nuts you get in brownies. i love almonds, but hated the taste of these. i forced myself to eat three of these bars so i could give them an accurate review, and that was extremely difficult.<br /><br />the selling point of pure bars are that they are made with natural, whole ingredients and are vegetarian and gluten-free.  as someone who is trying to avoid high fructose corn syrup and added sugar, i like that, however it doesn\'t do me any good if i can\'t enjoy the product enough to consume it.  i know some reviews have claimed that these are "health bars" and that they have too much sugar, but they are not marketed as a "health bar."  too many people confuse the ideas of "whole" and "natural" foods as "health" foods, which is entirely not the case. the idea is that these bars are for people who don\'t want additives and a lot of over-processing in their food, it\'s just unfortunately that they taste so bad.  if you\'re looking for a better-tasting alternative, i\'d suggestion the <a

room floor cradling greta, our 2 ½ year-old registered female pug.  greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a purina busy bone.<br /><br />i\'m left wondering how purina, a company with a name as iconic as betty crocker, bayer, gerber and general mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as i\'ve since discovered on the internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  i find this absolutely appalling.  i\'m 57 years-old and i\'ve put my trust in purina products since i was a child.  and now our beloved greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  and lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  she\'s simply devastated - and angry.  and so am i.<br /> did you know that in the united states its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  are you familiar with the westminster kennel club dog show series which includes the world\'s finest breeds in competition for "best in show," including the chinese pug?  do you have any idea of the loss we\'ve suffered at your negligent hands?<br /> i could talk about the money we paid for greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don\'t breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  and there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  i find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the kroger store from which we purchased your killing busy bone.<br /> i have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  i visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  he certainly appreciates those visits.  but he also has a fulltime companion - spencer, his jack russell terrier.  spencer will turn 12 in may.  dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the cleveland clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  and i believe if it weren\'t for the loving attention spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  his dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  something which purina has stolen away from us.  you\'d think that purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  but tragically that\'s not the case.<br /> yet there\'s more.  we also have a male pug which we named winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of winston churchill.  winston, like greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  and like us, he\'s now subdued.  he\'s actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn\'t understand why.  this concerns me.<br /> i am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  i work with the general public and i have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  as a result of losing greta, all i can think about now is me handing her a busy bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  the guilt is killing me.  how can i write?  how can i do anything?  grief passes they say.  but tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  and what makes things worse in this case is that greta\'s death could have been prevented.<br /> though both winston and greta liked the busy bone, several times in the past greta had gagged on it.  so, i served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation i assumed resolved the problem.  in retrospect i should have responded more to the concerns lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  in a brief moment, while we were in another room, greta died because of your product.  and why should such a product even exist?  why wasn\'t it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  why didn\'t purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?<br /> the answer is self-evident: gross negligence.  a negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in lori\'s and my life.  we\'ll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  i lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even i, a writer, cannot express in words.  it\'s now the closest we can get to our special friend.  we are utterly distraught.  greta, only 2 ½ years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  it\'s a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to purina.<br /> the very least purina can do is pull all forms of the busy bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before

these packets and they call it 5 servings. daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. you would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. the biggest concern i have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. the problem is entirely with the oil they are using. coconut oil. they list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. i asked great northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. they refused. it tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. in some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times

escargot for years at home and decided to upgrade my aging collection of olde pyrex and metal escargot plates and to have matching dishes to serve 6 friends or family.<br /><br />i just received my escargot plates-had hoped that the ceramic would be superior in heat retention.<br />my disappointment comes from the quality.  the plates themselves appear to be a heavy stoneware-like material.  they are not. worse still when i called the vendor i was told that each plate was very heavy and that was the reason for the high shipping cost.  a lot of nonsense and hooey.<br /><br />the glazing was incomplete on the bottoms of three out of 6, and on one of the handles.  this may result in moisture penetrating the ceramic.  it certainly will make clean up tougher.  the depressions are small at best to hold small snails and ample butter, and downright tight for the extra large snails. there is no lip on the edge which will allow for extra butter.  worst is that these are 4.5" in diameter-downright small.  very disappointing and i would not recommend these.<br /><br />they are, however, minimally functional and appear that they would retain heat similarly but not better than glass or ceramic plates without the bowl.<br /><br />also the picture seems to show a two tone dish, brown top with a more rustic grey brown lower section, like real stoneware,  as well as a taper-mine are not like this, they are evenly brown and not tapered.<br /><br />not happy as there as larger plain ceramic dishes available for half the price.  i thought these were a superior product.  i would not recommend these for the above reasons.  shipping prices posted are ridiculous.  actually, not ridiculous, they are outrageous, as all six, in thier cehap cardboard box (which holds six-likely originally sold as sets) weighed about 1.5 lbs total. the shipping prices quoted via the amazon portal are absurd.  these bowls are made in taiwan, which only bearing is that the cost versus quality is apparent.  whiel the description i accessed indicates these are made in france , they are not.<br /><br />imho a waste of money, unless you like the color and compactness. when i complained to the vendor i was dismayed at the customer service, including a claim for re-stocking fees for defective items shipped, something i have never encountered. more dismaying still, is that these items in the vendors catalog, included in my shipment , sell for almost a dollar less than listed here.  so not only does the seller charge high shipping, a handling charge, but also more than its own catalog price.  i think this is a vendor to be avoided from my experience.', "i moved to the east coast six years ago and must say that i have missed this particular treat.  i couldn't wait

vegetable classics hearty black bean soup is the best commercially produced, mass-marketed soup available.  it is a rich, hearty soup that is perfect for that cold winter evening meal.  the bacon-flavored base is more like a gravy and does not overpower the black bean taste.  the base is not thin and runny as are the broths on other canned soups.  the black beans are plentiful and are not cooked to a mushy consistency, but neither are they undercooked.  i like to serve progresso vegetable classics hearty black bean soup with a dollop of sour cream or a sprinkling of cheese; sometimes i add some cracked pepper and minced onion.<br /><br />however, progresso vegetable classics hearty black bean soup is very difficult to find.  the primary grocery chain in texas stopped carrying this variety of progresso soup several years ago.  shipping costs kept me from having out-of-state friends send me cases of progresso vegetable classics hearty black bean soup.  unfortunately, this is not a grocery product that amazon stocks or offers on the subscribe-and-save program, so i had to seek another source.  a careful internet search helped me find an online retailer who offered free shipping with a $39 order and an additional 15% off as a new customer.  as a result, my cost per can below $2. if you cannot obtain this soup locally, be sure to do an internet search for progresso vegetable classics hearty black bean soup before you buy.  prices vary widely.', "my wife grew up in the south caucasus where walnut preserve was a staple.  she got tempted into buying this product because the jar was big and the price affordable.  she said the taste was nowhere close to what she was used to back at home.  the taste of the syrup was too acidic, and it overpowered the taste of the walnuts.  the walnuts themselves were tiny and on the mushy side.  both the syrup and walnuts were honey-yellow in color, whereas the real syrup is supposed to be much darker (dark brown, almost black), and the nuts should preserve their original nutty flavor and a nice crunch with the soft interior. if you have ever tasted the real walnut preserve from the

it sat there a while i would have to throw it away. that was an expensive and wasteful way to go so i stopped.<br /><br />when i received the chef michael\'s sirloin i placed a small amount in my hand

his responses usually range from "i guess i\'ll eat it" to "i might eat it if i\'m desperate" to "i\'d rather starve."  the earth\'s best "creamy apple chicken compote" fell into that last category.  to be honest, i tried it, too--sometimes it motivates him when he sees you eating it, and liking it--and it was fairly foul.<br /><br />but since he\'s big for his age (already in 9 and 12 month sizes) and growing quickly, it\'s important that he get enough protein--which means that, really, we can\'t so much give into temptation and be like, "fine, eat applesauce."  and it\'s been a challenge finding high-protein foods that he likes and will reliably eat.  but he loves this stuff!!!  he\'ll eat it morning, noon and night.  he\'ll eat it when the house is quiet; he\'ll eat it

back on our experience with our first baby i\'m almost ashamed at how frantically we switched her formulas around, searching for an answer to her gassy, colicky behavior. i think in total we tried 7 or 8, from powder to ready-to-feed, hoping that one would be a magical formula that eased her tummy (and our eardrums) during her fussy evening hours.<br /><br />unfortunately, none of those formulas worked magic. it ended up being that our daughter\'s belly really did just need to grow & mature before she could readily digest formula, and even the hypo-allergenic ones made little difference in her spit-up or tummy achin\' behavior.<br /><br />however, similac sensitive was always our fall-back formula because it seemed to cause the least amount of stomach upset, didn\'t smell as horrible as some of the others, and with the coupons they send out (from strongmoms) - it was surprisingly affordable for the most part. strangely, our daughter would only drink ready-to-feed and would never finish a powder-prepared bottle and did seem more gassy after those. so we had to bite our bottom lips and put out the extra money for the liquid, which though expensive, was also very handy on trips and during late night feedings.<br /><br />similac sensitive still has a small amount of lactose in it, but it\'s broken down more than similac advance so it\'s easier to digest. and since it\'s already sterilized in the bottle, there are none of those new-parent worries over your powdered formula being contaminated or washing your hands before every bottle you make/feed. trust me, when you\'re running on 2 hours of sleep, these "simple pleasures" can really make a big difference. i also called similac\'s customer service on several occasions to ask questions and they were polite and helpful, and even sent coupons!<br /><br />we used similac sensitive until our daughter was ready to transition to cow\'s milk, and although we tried cheaper versions and many other formulas in an attempt to save money, we could never find anything our baby would take as easily as similac sensitive, so we stuck by it and would do so with the next baby should the need arise.<br /><br />**********update**********<br />we just had our second child and immediately skipped all other formulas and went straight to similac sensitive. this has saved so much trouble from the first time around! baby #2 is doing great on this formula, however, he has been diagnosed with acid reflux. this means feedings are very difficult and painful. the only alternative to try from this formula is nutramigen, but its too expensive. we are giving baby #2 zantac prescribed from his pediatrictian and it seems to be helping.<br /><br />it wasn\'t mentioned before, but if your baby is taking similac sensitive, but still having a lot of spit up or acts differently on the powder vs rtf. this is probably because the rtf is much thicker and babies are able to handle it better. the rtf is also much easier to digest than the powdered version because the nutrients have been fully dissolved 100% into liquid. however, with the powder, baby\'s belly may have to work a little harder to process the powder. because our children have acid reflux, powder is not an option. the less spit up, the better because stomach acid is brought back up into the esophagus the more they spit up.', 'in reading the

amount or it will burn.<br /><br />whenever a good product is cheapened like this i always do an online search to see if the company was acquired, and sure enough, conagra bought orville redenbacher.

being pushed up a little.  this happened for the first three times i filled the storage container (within a short period of time, as i have been eating a lot of the olives!).  what i found out is that this is good - it means that, like real yogurt, these olives are naturally fermented and have the "good probiotics" in them, which are very helpful to your digestive system.  apparently, most pickled type foods sold in the u.s. are pasteurized which stops this process.  i read some research suggesting that it is very good to consume safely prepared and preserved pickled/fermented products, such as

dark that it seems like it must be organ meats (which i have no problem with if it didnt taste awful).  smells: the smell is so strong the second you open the pouch and very much like a can of cat or dog food. tastes: i taste all of the baby food i give my daughter.  it was pungent and metallic, where the banana and coconut were, lord only knows.  if you must try it, i get it i would too, just buy

chunkier than plum or happy tot.  you can see bit of veg and grains.  holiday veg w/ turkey is a big hit as is the pumpkin peach graham (i serve together but not mixed).  roasted banana mango is really yummy and she loves the yukon golds with squash and parmesan.<br /><br />beyond sprout, we prefer:<br /><br />fruits and veg: ellas for a richer consistency and better flavor than plum or happy

it.<br /><br />breakfast: happy squeeze (tot) organic super smoothies are awesome, in fact, i'm going to start having them for breakfast myself.  all of them taste excellent! have 100% adult dv of

the curry chicken) we have yet to try the salmon but have a case of it ready to go.  she likes the potato and turkey with rosemary (tastes like an herby mash potato) and the chicken pasta (not

to the fact that she would only eat the innova evo when it was mixed in with some wet food, and oftentimes only with a bit of cottage cheese mixed in.<br /><br />shortly after being on this high-protein diet (we didn\'t even finish her small bag of food), she began to urinate around the house, which she hasn\'t done in the 5 months we\'ve had her.  it turns out she had urinary crystals,

schools. nutmeg is particularly notorious for losing its flavor quickly when ground, so all cooks who use nutmeg regularly know that you have to use the nutmeg minutes after you grind/grate it. from this standpoint, it is better than the ground nutmeg every big-brand spice vendor under the sun sells-- which is to say, it\'s better than sawdust.<br /><br />the moment i decided never to use plastic spice grinders again was when i made some pumpkin pie with this stuff, because one of the first things i noticed was that i could feel the bits of nutmeg in the final product, kind of like tiny corn cob bits. i also noticed that while the nutmeg flavor wasn\'t completely gone, it wasn\'t as strong as it was when we first bought it, because this is filled with chunks of nutmeg rather than whole nuts-- that increases the surface area and the rate of loss of volatile flavor compounds.<br /><br />this stuff works okay in things like oatmeal cookies, where you\'re not going to notice the texture of the rather coarsely ground nutmeg. but for anything else, you\'re best off doing what the tv cooks do, and getting whole nutmeg and a grater like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00004s7v7">microplane stainless steel zester</a> and just grating a little off into the dish you\'re making. the flavor will be stronger, there won\'t be any grit from the nutmeg, and you will have a nice tool for other tasty things like citrus zest and parmesan cheese. plus, you can easily find whole nutmeg now online or in some brick-and-mortar

no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. the problem is entirely with the oil they are using. coconut oil. they list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. i asked great northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. they refused. it tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. in some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. i love popcorn.

cocker spaniels.  i gradually transitioned from the iams to bb.  as the transition progressed, my dogs appeared to be more hungry at each feeding.  as it turned out, i think that they were just starting to enjoy their food for the first time in their short little lives. sad, really.  but how can a person tell if a dog food actually tastes good?  if i were to pick a dog food based on what i think might taste good, i would be feeding my dogs beneful dog food (their commercials make me hungry).  in any case, they seem to love bb.  so that\'s the review from the dog\'s point of view.<br /><br />as for how this change in dog food has impacted my life.  i live on a half acre and my two cockers can really spread wealth, if you know what i mean.  i really like to keep the lawn "bomb free" so my kids and i pick-up the lawn often.  when the dogs were eating iams, the "surprises" that they would create would lay softly beneath the top blades of grass, just waiting for someone to come step on them.  it was too often an ugly situation that i will not describe here.  since we have been feeding the dogs bb, those "duce-balls" now sit lightly upon the top of the grass.  they are light, easy to see and very firm (eauwwwww!) as a result, pick-up is quicker and the lawn is cleaner.<br /><br />i suggest you give this food a try, but be cautious.  based on some reviews, bb has had some quality problems in the past.  nobody wants to lose their animal due to negligence on the part of a dog food company.  as with any change in your dog\'s diet, monitor closely.  even if a food is safe and healthy, not all foods agree with all animals.  so remember, be cautious, we all want the best for man\'s best friend.', 'i made the  mistake of opening a package of these mediterranean

blood thinners. eating foods with coumarin may be dangerous for people taking blood thinners, because the combination could increase their risk of bleeding.<br /><br />mexican vanilla -- which may smell and taste like real vanilla and is cheaper than the real thing -- is sold in mexico and other latin american countries and has started appearing in some u.s. stores and restaurants, the fda

that belongs to the pea family. tonka bean extract contains coumarin. since 1954, coumarin has been banned from all food products sold in the united states.<br /><br />consumers should be cautious

recently found that our cat has an allergy to chicken so we went on a search for a food that was equal in quality to the ones she was use to.  our first attempt at a replacement was lamb and brought catastrophic results.  her eyes even got red and swollen from just a few bites!  very sad.  we had given her duck before so i felt it would be pretty safe to try this one. being from the school of hesitation, first she sniffed her bowl at every point it seemed.  i was beginning to wonder if she would grace me with consuming it at all.  first she nibbled on some of her regular food that was mixed in, which tonight was the newman's organic turkey.  then she started in on the duck and that was it!  she finished her whole bowl and licked it clean in good time for her because she is my pokey one.  it seems like a winner for her and i have to say i was very impressed with the food as well.  the consistency is like a course grind which i think she liked better than a smooth pate.  you could see the carrots and peas mixed in and it had a nice sauce around it.  this seems like a regular for her.<br /><br />update 12-31-2011 : i do have to say that our allergy challenged kitty started having the same itchy, scaly skin with this duck as she did with her chicken.  i still would give it 5 stars though, because it is an incredible food...just not for her.  turns out all she seems to be able to eat is rabbit.  she loves it and there hasn't been anymore flaky skin or excessive shedding since she has been on only that protein.<br /><br />update 2-13-2012 : our oldest cat has now developed a chicken allergy so i tried this for her and she still was flaky too.  i think the turkey liver, which is the second ingredient, has been the culprit all along.  we'll see as we go on with her testing.  she is able to have rabbit and beef though so that is a huge peace of mind for me.  blue buffalo makes a duck that is all duck and we are trying that for her as well.  i did take a star

pancake texture isn\'t particularly good either. if you live in michigan, illinois, indiana, ohio, or kentucky, go to your local meijer grocery store and buy their brand of malted pancake mix. the malt taste and fluffy texture are far superior to carbon\'s, and the mix costs less than half as much. if you don\'t live in one of those states and are primarily interested in making pancakes, use

10 has just become very expensive.  i recently ordered a case & it has doubled in price.  why, i do not know.  not happy with this, but nothing out there has the "taste of suger" like sweet 10.  my grocery store has discontinued carrying sweet 10.  the only place i can get it is amazon.  no problem with this, but i am not happy with the price.', "i paid for a beautiful gift like the picture but

definately purchase it again.  my cake turned out wonderful.  the color is lovely, and if you don't want to use it strictly for cooking/baking, it's more than fragrant enough to put around the house,

is one of the things that have kept me walking on the, "green side of the grass".', "i have been a coffee drinker for the past 10 years, admittedly starting a bit later than my friends around me.  i began by drinking whatever drip coffee starbucks was serving on a given day, and, over time, i graduated to asking only for the bold drip that was on tap that morning.<br /><br />over the past year and a half, starbucks has lost their way by adding the pikes place and blonde roast blends and rotating their bold coffee selections such that the coffee i have grown fond of drinking, is now only offered in their stores on an occasional basis, much to my chagrin.<br /><br />fast forward to a weekend last year with in-laws where i was introduced to a plethora of bold coffee choices in the form of k-cup coffee, which i initally took for gimmick coffee, since i have always believed that the best coffee must be brewed directly from a freshly grounded coffee bean, and that anything that comes under the heading of instant was what lazy coffee drinkers called their morning cup of joe.<br /><br />well, i must admit that after sampling nearly 10 brands of k-cup coffee, i was finally able to enjoy a cup of the starbucks verona blend.  in the space of 2 mornings of drinking verona k-cup coffee, i am a changed man.  i have stopped going to starbucks or other local coffee houses in search of a consistently good tasting bold coffee.  i have stopped because the rich, sweet verona coffee flavor that i have come to associate with a good cup of coffee comes in a little plastic cup that i load every morning into my newest kitchen appliance.<br /><br />i am still a little chapped at the price to buy the verona k-cup (both amazon and elsewhere), but i advise you to look around, as there are deals to be found, if you are willing to do some investigative work and are willing to buy a larger quantity.  i purhcased a 54 count box of verona at costco for approx 60 cnets a k-cup.<br /><br />as for me, since the middle of june 2012, i have made my coffee every morning in my kitchen, and i am grateful to live in a time when as a consumer, i have a choice in how i choose to spend my coffee allowance.<br /><br />it may not be everyone's prescribed method to procure and consume coffee -- i must admit that i have always enjoyed the daily banter that comes with visiting my local starbucks (i have come to know over 50 starbucks baristas in the time i have been a starbucks customer), but in the end, the uneven quality and lack of consistenty in their coffee offerings has led to me to the decision to enjoy the bold, sweet verona blend coffee in the comfort of my home (for the record, i set my k-cup coffee maker to dispense 6 oz of water with each k-cup i use, in order to realize the dark roast flavor that i desire).<br /><br />the verona blend has consistently been rated the #1 choice among starbucks customers, and their team of mixers has configured a k-cup flavor that captures the essence of what i first tasted in a starbucks storefront here in the heart of silicon valley so many years ago.", "i was a bit disappointed with illy.  it has a great aroma, but when brewed it doesn't have a strong coffee taste or boldness.  i drink coffee to wake up in the morning and break the fog, but this coffee just doesn't pack the punch to get me going.  i really wonder what they put in this espresso coffee to make it so aromatic? it almost smells like pipe tobacco mixed with rum.  all caffeine effects me differently, this espresso made my hair go limp and i just couldn't get

was only 1.  on top of that, the shipping charge was about as much as the actual 5 oz. bag of nuts.  about $4.50 for each.  there are much better deals on this product out there on amazon, so just
